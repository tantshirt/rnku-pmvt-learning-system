The strength of the military depends on disciplined service members, ready to fight and win our
nation’s wars. As stated in AFI 1-1, because military discipline enhances combat capability, because the military environment and duties are unique, and because military personnel serve
throughout the world, a special system of laws and courts is required to maintain good order and
military discipline. Good order and discipline are essential to maintaining a warfighting capability. Just as importantly, a fair and impartial system of military justice safeguards the morale of those
who risk their lives in service to their nation. No other judicial system provides such expansive
worldwide coverage or definitive purpose. 21.2. Commander Responsibilities
Effective leadership is the most desirable means of maintaining standards. Military law provides
commanders certain tools, including court-martial and nonjudicial punishment, to address
misconduct. Military commanders are responsible for maintaining law and order in the
communities over which they have authority, and for maintaining the discipline of the fighting
force. Ordinarily, the immediate commander determines how to dispose of an offense; however, a
superior commander may withhold that authority, and, in certain categories of cases, such as
sexual assaults and related misconduct arising from a sexual assault, the law gives specific
authorities to the Office of the Special Trial Counsel. The Staff Judge Advocate is available to
provide advice regarding issues of alleged misconduct. Commander Discretion. One of the commander’s greatest powers in the administration of
military justice is the exercise of discretion, to decide how misconduct committed by a member of
his or her command will be resolved. Each commander in the chain of command has independent
yet overlapping discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer’s authority. A
commander may dispose of a case by taking no action, initiating administrative action against the
member, offering the member nonjudicial punishment, or preferring court-martial charges. However, under recent changes to the UCMJ by Congress, certain offenses, known as “covered
offenses,” including sexual assault, murder, domestic violence, child pornography, and many
other serious offenses, are under the exclusive court-martial authority of the Office of Special
Trial Counsel in accordance with Article 24a, UCMJ. If a commander believes non-covered
offenses should be disposed of by court-martial, the commander may prefer charges and forward
the charges to the convening authority. The convening authority must personally make the decision
to refer a case to trial by court-martial. Charges may be referred to one of three types of courtmartial: summary, special, or general. The types of courts-martial are discussed in greater detail
later in this chapter. 21.3. Individual Responsibilities
The military justice system is a tool used to correct and punish breaches of discipline. All Airmen
have a general responsibility to be familiar with the military justice system, correct marginal or
substandard behavior or duty performance of their subordinates and support their commander in
the application of the military justice system for maintaining good order and discipline. This
<!-- Page 400 -->

requires becoming involved when breaches of discipline occur and reporting all such violations to
the proper authorities. Individuals should be prepared to investigate incidents when ordered to do
so. It is important for all Airmen to be familiar with the right against self-incrimination under
Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, know the resources available to assist in
conducting legal investigations, and seek advice from servicing judge advocates or Area Defense
Counsels before acting. Self-Reporting of Criminal Conviction. According to DAFPD 36-29, Military Standards, all
commissioned officers and enlisted members who are on RegAF or in an active status in a Reserve
Component will report, in writing, any conviction for a violation of a U. S. criminal law to their
first-line military supervisor or the appropriate designated official within 45 days of the date of
conviction. Additionally, pursuant to AFI 1-1, Airmen above the pay grade of E-6, on RegAF, or
on active status in a Reserve Component must report any violation of any civilian criminal law, in writing, to their first-line supervisor within 15 days of the date of conviction. 21.4. Pillars of Military Justice
Four primary components of the military
justice system, as shown in Figure 21.1., include the U.S. Constitution, the Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the Manual
for Courts-Martial
(MCM), and Legal
Precedents. These pillars are discussed here to
provide an understanding of how they were
established and how they shape our military
justice system. The U.S. The U.S. Constitution. Constitution, the first pillar in the military
justice system, is the ultimate source of
authority from which all military law is
derived. The framers of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the authority to make rules for the
military. Congress (the legislative branch) and the U.S. President (the executive branch) have used
their combined authority to create the military justice system we know today. This separation of
powers ensures a checks-and-balances function in overseeing our military justice system. Figure 21.1. The Military Justice System Pillars
Powers Granted to Congress. The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress is empowered to
declare war; raise and support armies; provide and maintain naval forces; make rules for the
government and regulation of the land and naval forces; provide for calling forth the militia
(National Guard); organize, arm, and discipline the militias; and govern such part of them as may
be employed in the service of the United States. Congress is also responsible for all laws deemed
necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested
by the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. Government. Authority Granted to the President. The U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. President
serves as Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces and of the militia of the states (National
Guard) when called to federal service. By virtue of authority as Commander in Chief, the U.S. President has the power to issue executive orders to govern the U.S. Armed Forces as long as these
orders do not conflict with basic constitutional or statutory provisions. Uniform Code of Military Justice. The UCMJ is the second pillar in the military justice system. In 1947, in the aftermath of the Second World War, and after unification of the Armed Services
under the Department of Defense, Secretary James V. Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defense, <!-- Page 401 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
401
desired a uniform legal code that would apply to all services. His efforts set the stage for a uniform
system of discipline that Congress enacted in 1950 as the UCMJ. Signed into law by President
Harry S. Truman, the UCMJ became effective in 1951 and provided substantial procedural
guarantees for an open and fair process that continues today. The UCMJ encompasses the sorts of crimes outlawed in all jurisdictions, such as murder, arson, larceny, etc., and crimes largely unique to the military environment. Unique military crimes
addressed under the UCMJ include such offenses as desertion, absence without leave, disrespect
toward superiors, failure to obey orders, dereliction of duty, wrongful disposition of military
property, drunk while on-duty, malingering, and conduct unbecoming an officer. The UCMJ also
includes provisions regarding punishing misbehavior before the enemy, improper use of
countersign, misbehavior of a sentinel, misconduct as a prisoner, aiding the enemy, spying, and
espionage. Since its enactment, the UCMJ has undergone several significant changes, largely
designed to provide service members with additional due process rights in criminal proceedings. The rights afforded to service members today largely mirror the due process safeguards of civilian
courts, and in certain aspects, are even more expansive than those enjoyed by civilians. Manual for Courts-Martial. The MCM is a publication, covering virtually all aspects of military
criminal law, which is intended to serve as a comprehensive manual or guidebook for facilitating
military justice worldwide. It contains the current version of the UCMJ, Rules for Courts-Martial, and Military Rules of Evidence, as well as templates, scripts, and analysis for use by military
justice practitioners in the field. The MCM is divided into five parts that serve as binding authority
for practitioners. Part I is the Preamble and explains the sources of authority for and structure of
the MCM. Part II is the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM), which are similar to the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure used in civilian courts. The RCM largely serve to guide court-martial
procedure. Part III is the Military Rules of Evidence (MRE), which closely resemble Federal Rules
of Evidence and are designed to promote fairness in how evidence is admitted and used in courtsmartial. Part IV outlines the punitive articles of the UCMJ, that is, the articles that service members
may be charged with violating at a court-martial. Part V describes the rules and procedures for
Article 15, nonjudicial punishment. Additionally, the MCM contains a number of non-binding
appendices, including analysis of the punitive articles, a maximum punishment table for the
punitive articles, and various templates and scripts. These appendices are designed to serve as
helpful guidance for military justice practitioners as they prepare for or conduct courts-martial. Precedents. Precedents, the fourth pillar in the military justice system, refer to the prior decisions
of appellate courts of the armed forces, as well as decisions of federal and state courts in certain
instances. One of the primary functions of appellate courts is to resolve contentious questions about
whether the law was correctly applied to facts of any individual court-martial. A decision of the
Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, or its superior court, the Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces, normally serves as binding precedent in future courts-martial or appeals where the same
issue arises. Additionally, the decisions of other armed forces courts, e.g., the Army Court of
Criminal Appeals, may serve as persuasive authority for judges and practitioners considering
similar issues. As a matter of practicality, the punitive articles, RCM, and MRE are unable to
address every possible legal issue that can arise in a court-martial. Precedents serve to fill those
gaps. 21.5. Legal Rights
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces are afforded most of the procedural due process rights enjoyed
by civilians in criminal cases, including protection against involuntary self-incrimination and the
right to counsel. However, the Supreme Court and military appellate courts have repeatedly held
that the Constitution and Bill of Rights do not apply in their entirety to courts-martial. For instance, <!-- Page 402 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
402
court-martial juries—called panels—are not required to reach a unanimous verdict in order to
convict members of a criminal offense (with the exception of capital cases, meaning cases where
the death penalty is an authorized punishment). Complaints of Wrongs under Article 138. Article 138, UCMJ, is a provision for protecting
members’ rights and for addressing grievances. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces who believe
they have been wronged by their commanding officer may seek redress with the commanding
officer informally, and then with a superior authority if their request is denied. A properly filed
Article 138 complaint ultimately ends with review and action by the general court-martial
convening authority with jurisdiction over the commanding officer whose actions are the subject
of the complaint. However, not all grievances are appropriate for redress through an Article 138
complaint. Any adverse event that has its own procedures for appeal and redress normally cannot
be made the subject of an Article 138 complaint. For instance, a conviction at court-martial, Article
## nonjudicial punishment, or poor enlisted evaluation report, all have their own processes for
appeal. An Article 138 complaint about the outcome of such an event is not eligible for review. Absent unusual circumstances, the member must apply for redress within 90 calendar days of the
discovery of the wrong complained of, and the complaint should contain all available supporting
evidence. AFI 51-505, Complaints of Wrongs Under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military
Justice, contains detailed guidance of the substantive and procedural requirements for filing an
Article 138 complaint. Airmen considering this action may consult their servicing Area Defense
Counsel for advice and should ensure that they comply strictly with the requirements of AFI 51505. Compulsory Self-incrimination Prohibited. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
states that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against him or herself. Similarly, Article
31, UCMJ, reflects this right and prohibits involuntary statements from being used against an
accused. A statement is “involuntary” when obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Article
31, or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement. The UCMJ
requires that prior to interrogation or any requests for a statement from a person suspected of an
offense, the person must be first told of the nature of the accusation, advised that he or she does
not have to make any statement regarding the offense, and that any statement he or she makes may
be used as evidence against him or her in a trial by court-martial. Prior to interrogation, the suspect
is entitled to consult with military defense counsel and to have such counsel present at the
questioning. If counsel is requested, questioning must cease until counsel is present. Once properly
advised of his or her rights, a person may waive these rights and choose to make a statement. Assuming this waiver is made freely, knowingly, and intelligently, any subsequent statement can
be used as evidence in a court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceedings. Right to Counsel. The UCMJ provides an accused the right to be represented by a military defense
counsel at general courts-martial, special courts-martial, and any Article 32 preliminary hearing. Although the UCMJ does not grant an accused the right to counsel at summary courts-martial, or
when facing nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, the USAF generally provides military
defense counsel in these forums as a matter of policy. The Area Defense Counsel provides USAF
members independent legal representation. All Area Defense Counsel are judge advocates who
are graduates of an accredited law school, members of the bar of a federal court or highest court
of a State and who are certified to perform defense duties by The Judge Advocate General of the
Air Force. Airmen suspected of an offense or facing adverse administrative actions receive free, confidential legal advice from an experienced judge advocate outside the local chain of command, which guards against conflicts of interest or command influence. Although located at most major
bases, Area Defense Counsel work for a separate chain of command and report directly to senior
defense attorneys. The Area Defense Counsel does not report to anyone at base level, including
<!-- Page 403 -->

the wing commander or the base Staff Judge Advocate. This separate chain of command ensures
undivided loyalty to the client. <!-- Page 404 -->

### Law Enforcement Duties
B
C
B
C
C
All Airmen should be familiar with the rules for apprehending, arresting, and confining violators
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Apprehension. Apprehension is the act of taking a person into custody and the equivalent of a
civilian arrest. An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person, orally or in writing, that
he or she is in custody. The simple statement, “You are under apprehension,” is usually sufficient
to provide notice. During apprehension, such force and means as are reasonably necessary under
the circumstances to affect the apprehension, are authorized. Military law enforcement officers, military criminal investigators, and persons on guard or performing police duties, are authorized
to apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction. Although all commissioned, warrant, petty, and enlisted members on RegAF status may apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, absent exigent (urgent or necessary) circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be done
by law enforcement personnel. Enlisted members not otherwise performing law enforcement
duties may apprehend commissioned or warrant officers only on specific orders from a
commissioned officer or when such apprehension prevents disgrace to the service or to prevent the
commission of a serious offense or escape of someone who has committed a serious offense. The
immediate commander of an apprehended person should be promptly notified. Pretrial Restraint. Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person’s liberty that is
imposed before and during the disposition of offenses. Pretrial restraint may only be ordered if
there is a reasonable belief that the person committed an offense triable by court-martial, and if
the circumstances require restraint. Factors to consider in ordering pretrial restraint include
whether one can foresee that the person will not appear at trial or will engage in serious criminal
misconduct while awaiting court-martial. Pretrial restraint should not be more rigorous than the
circumstances require. Only an officer’s commander can order pretrial restraint of an officer; this
authority cannot be delegated. Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any
enlisted person. An enlisted person’s commander may also delegate such restraint authority to an
enlisted member. Pretrial restraint may include conditions on liberty, restrictions in lieu of arrest, arrest, or confinement, as briefly described here. Conditions on Liberty. Conditions on liberty as a pretrial restraint are imposed by directing
a person to do or refrain from doing specified acts. Examples include orders to report
periodically to a specified official, orders to stay away from a certain place (such as the scene
of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons (such as the alleged
victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on liberty must not hinder pretrial preparation. Restrictions in Lieu of Arrest. Restrictions in lieu of arrest are imposed as the restraint of a
person by oral or written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits, but to a
less severe level than arrest. The geographic limits are usually broader (for example, restriction
to the limits of the installation). During restrictions in lieu of arrest, the alleged offender will
perform full military duties, unless otherwise directed. Arrest. In the U.S. Armed Forces, the term “arrest” means the limiting of a person’s liberty. Arrest as a pretrial restraint is not imposed as punishment for an offense, but it does direct a
person to remain within specified limits. Arrest is a moral restraint; no physical restraint is
<!-- Page 405 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
405
exercised to prevent a person from breaking arrest. A person in arrest is not expected to perform
full military duties. Confinement. Confinement is the pretrial, physical restraint imposed by order of competent
authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of charges. No person may be ordered
into pretrial confinement except for upon probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial
confinement exists when there is reasonable belief that: (1) an offense triable by court-martial has
been committed, (2) the person confined committed it, and (3) confinement is required by the
circumstances. Each person confined shall promptly be informed of: (1) the nature of the offenses
for which held, (2) the right to remain silent and that any statement made by the person may be
used against the person, (3) the right to retain civilian counsel at no expense to the United States
and the right to request assignment of military counsel, and (4) the procedures by which pretrial
confinement will be reviewed. 21.7. Search and Seizure
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and
seizures. The authorization to search must be based on probable cause, particularly describe the
place to be searched, and describe the persons or things to be seized. Probable cause to search
exists when there is a reasonable belief that the person, property, or evidence sought is located in
the place or on the person to be searched. “Authorization to search” is the military equivalent of a
civilian search warrant. A search authorization is an express permission, written or oral, issued by
a competent military authority to search a person or an area for specified property or evidence, or
to search for a specific person and to seize such property, evidence, or person. Commanders, military judges, and magistrates may be authorized to direct inspections of persons
and property under their command authority and to authorize probable cause searches and seizures
over anyone subject to military law or at any place on an installation. A commander who authorizes
a search or seizure must be neutral and detached from the case and facts. Therefore, the command
functions of gathering facts and maintaining overall military discipline must remain separate from
the legal decision to grant search authorization. 21.8. Inspections
An inspection is of a person, property, or premises for the primary purpose of determining and
ensuring the security, military fitness, or good order and discipline of a unit, organization, or
installation. Commanders may conduct inspections of their units. Inspections are not searches. The
distinction between a search and an inspection is that an inspection is not conducted for the primary
purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial or other disciplinary proceedings and does not focus
on a particular suspect or individual. Contraband seized during an inspection (for example, vehicle
entry checks and random drug testing) is admissible in court. <!-- Page 406 -->

## Section 21C — Nonjudicial Punishment B B C C C

### Administrative Procedures
B
C
B
C
C
Nonjudicial punishment is authorized under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Often referred to as an Article 15, nonjudicial punishment provides commanders with an essential
and prompt means of maintaining good order and discipline and promotes positive behavior
changes in service members without the stigma of a court-martial conviction. Any USAF member
can be punished by Article 15. Generally, nonjudicial punishment should be reserved for “minor
offenses” under the UCMJ. Commanders are encouraged, but not required, to offer counseling and
administrative reprimands before resorting to the Article 15 process. Minor Offense. Whether or not an offense is minor depends on several factors and is a matter left
to the imposing commander’s discretion. Besides the nature of the offense, the commander should
also consider the alleged offender’s age, grade, duty assignments, record, experience, and the
maximum sentence imposable for the offense if tried by a general court-martial. Ordinarily, a
minor offense is an offense for which the maximum sentence authorized would not include a
dishonorable discharge or confinement for more than one year if tried by a general court-martial. Procedures. Commanders must confer with the Staff Judge Advocate, or a designee, before
initiating nonjudicial punishment proceedings and before imposing punishment. The Staff Judge
Advocate advises and helps the commander evaluate the facts and determine whether and what
offense was committed. Unlike administrative actions, nonjudicial punishment actions may only
allege violations of a punitive article of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The standard of
proof that commanders must apply in determining guilt is preponderance of the evidence. This
means that a commander must determine, based on the evidence considered, that it is more likely
than not that the member committed the alleged offense. Superior commanders serving as appeal
authority must apply the same standard. Record of Nonjudicial Punishment. If the commander does determine that nonjudicial
punishment is appropriate, the Staff Judge Advocate or military justice section of the base legal
AF Form 3070C, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (Officer)
The commander notifies the member that he or she is considering punishment under Article 15 by
signing the appropriate AF Form 3070 and providing it to the member. The form includes a
statement of the alleged offense(s), the member’s rights, and the maximum punishment allowable. After receiving the form, the member has a right to examine all statements and evidence available
to the commander and is not required to accept or reject nonjudicial punishment sooner than 72
hours following notification. The initiating commander may, upon written application, grant an
extension for good cause. Acceptance of nonjudicial punishment by a member is a choice of forum, not an acceptance of guilt. An Airman who is served nonjudicial punishment has the right to “turn
down” the nonjudicial punishment and demand trial by court-martial for the offense(s) he or she
is accused of. Additionally, the member has a right to consult an Area Defense Counsel before
making any decisions, and an Area Defense Counsel, or civilian attorney provided at the member’s
own expense, may assist the member throughout the nonjudicial punishment proceedings. If a
<!-- Page 407 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
407
member does accept the nonjudicial punishment forum, he or she has the right to present matters
in defense, extenuation, or mitigation to the commander on his or her own behalf and make a
personal appearance before the commander, except in extraordinary circumstances or when the
commander is unavailable. 21.10. Punishments Under Article 15
If the commander finds the member committed an offense, he or she will determine the appropriate
punishment, serve his or her decision upon the member, and notify the member of the right to
appeal. Punishments may include reduction in grade, forfeiture of pay, restrictions, extra duties, and correctional custody. The type and permissible extent of punishment are limited by the
imposing commander’s grade and the alleged offender’s grade. Table 21.1. is provided here as a
generalized reference; however, for detailed, specific information regarding punishments under
Article 15, refer to AFI 36-2502 and DAFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment. R

Notes: See Manual for Courts-Martial, part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of
specified commands, or commanders to whom promotion authority to these grades has been delegated. See
AFI 36-2502. DAFI 51-202, Table 3.1. Bread and water and diminished rations punishments are not authorized. Frocked commanders may exercise only that authority associated with their actual pay grade. No authority
is conferred by the frocked grade. Table 21.1. Permissible Nonjudicial Punishments on Enlisted Members (Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4)
Member’s Right to Appeal. Members are entitled to appeal nonjudicial punishment to the next
superior authority in the commander’s chain of command. The member may appeal when he or
she considers the punishment to be unjust or disproportionate to the offense. A member may assert
the punishment was unjust because the offense was not committed. Thus, the guilty finding, the
punishment, or both, may be appealed. The member has five calendar days to submit a written
appeal—an oral statement is not acceptable. Punishments are not stayed (suspended or halted)
during the appeal process; however, if the commander or appellate authority fail to take action on
an appeal within five days after submission, and if the member so requests, any unexecuted
punishment involving restraint or extra duties will be delayed until after appeal. The appellate
authority may deny all relief, grant partial relief, or grant all relief requested by the member. The
appellate authority’s decision is final. 21.11. Suspension, Remission, Mitigation, and Set-Aside Actions
A commander has the power to suspend, remit, mitigate, or set aside punishment of an Article 15. Suspension. To suspend punishment is to postpone application of all or part of a specific
probationary period with the understanding that the punishment will be automatically remitted
(canceled) at the end of this period if the member does not engage in further misconduct. The
probationary period may not exceed six months. Suspension may occur when the commander
imposes the punishment or within four months of executing the punishment. USAF policy
encourages the use of suspended sentences as a corrective tool for first-time offenders to provide
an observation period and an incentive for good behavior. Remission. Remission is an action whereby any portion of the unexecuted punishment is canceled, normally used as a reward for good behavior or when determined the punishment imposed was too
severe for the particular offense. Mitigation. Mitigation is a reduction in either the quantity or quality of a punishment. Commanders may, at any time, mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the
punishment by changing to a less severe form or reducing the quantity. For example, a reduction
in grade can be mitigated to a forfeiture of pay. Set Aside. Setting aside is an action whereby the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, is
set aside and any property, privilege, or rights affected by the portion of the punishment set aside
are restored. Commanders use this action only when they believe, under all the circumstances of
the case, the punishment has resulted in clear injustice. <!-- Page 409 -->

### Uniform Code of Military Justice Punitive Articles
Punitive articles consist of Articles 77 through 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), violations of which are punishable by court-martial. The punitive articles are written to include
certain verbiage to provide clarification regarding the text of the article (brief description of the
offense), elements of the offense, explanation, lesser included offenses, maximum punishment, and sample specifications regarding the punishable offense. For full descriptions of punitive
articles, maximum punishments regarding applicable discharge, forfeiture of pay and allowances, confinement; and specifications regarding the circumstances, refer to Manual for Courts-Martial
(MCM), Part IV, Punitive Articles. Note: Article 134 is designed to address unspecified offenses, termed “disorders and neglects,” that are punishable because they either prejudice good order and
discipline or otherwise discredit the armed forces in the view of society. Article 134 also provides
elements and definitions for certain military-specific offenses not addressed elsewhere in the
punitive articles of the UCMJ. 21.13. Types of Courts-Martial
Congress established three levels of courts-martial: General (GCM), Special (SPCM) and
Summary (SCM). The levels differ according to the limitations upon punishment that can be
imposed by each. The three types are described here. Summary Court-Martial. Summary courts-martial have jurisdiction to try enlisted members
subject to the UCMJ accused of any noncapital offense made punishable by the UCMJ. No person
with respect to whom summary courts-martial have jurisdiction may be brought to trial before a
summary court-martial if he or she objects. If objection to trial by summary court-martial is made, trial may be ordered by special or general court-martial, as appropriate. Summary courts-martial
may, under such limitations as the U.S. President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not
forbidden by the UCMJ except death, dismissal, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than one month, hard-labor without confinement for more than 45 days, restriction to specified limits for more than two months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds of
one month’s pay. A summary court-martial consists of one commissioned officer and is a noncriminal forum. A finding of guilty at a summary court-martial does not constitute a criminal
conviction. Special Court-Martial. Special courts-martial have jurisdiction to try members subject to the
UCMJ for any noncapital offense made punishable by the UCMJ, and under such regulations as
the U.S. President may prescribe, for capital offenses. Special courts-martial may, under such
limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by the UCMJ
except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for more than one year, hard labor
without confinement for more than three months, forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per
month, or forfeiture of pay for more than one year. A special court-martial may consist of a military
judge with a panel of four members (plus alternate members if authorized by the convening
authority), a military judge alone, or in some cases, with the consent of the parties involved, a
military magistrate. A subset of Special Court-Martial is the Judge-Alone Special Court-Martial. If charges are
referred to a judge-alone special court-martial, the maximum punishments of a traditional special
<!-- Page 410 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
410
court-martial are further limited to confinement of no more than six months and forfeitures of pay
of no more than six months. If charges are referred to a judge-alone special court-martial, the
maximum punishments of a traditional special court-martial are further limited to confinement of
no more than six months and forfeitures of pay of no more than six months. Further, a punitive
discharge may not be imposed. General Court-Martial. General courts-martial have jurisdiction to try persons subject to the
UCMJ for any offense made punishable by the UCMJ and may, under such limitations as the U.S. President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by the UCMJ, including the
penalty of death when specifically authorized by the UCMJ. General courts-martial also have
jurisdiction to try any person who, by the law of war, is subject to trial by a military tribunal, and
may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war. However, in certain circumstances, general courts-martial shall not have jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the
death penalty may be adjudged unless the case has been previously referred to trial as a noncapital
case. A general court-martial may consist of a military judge with a panel of eight or more
members, a military judge alone, or in capital cases, a military judge with a panel of twelve
members. 21.14. Determining Court-Martial Jurisdiction
Courts-martial jurisdiction is concerned with two questions: Personal jurisdiction (Is the accused a person subject to the UCMJ?)
Subject-matter jurisdiction (Is the conduct prohibited by the UCMJ?)
If the answer is “yes” in both instances, then and only then does a court-martial have jurisdiction
to decide the case. Personal Jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction involves status, that is, the accused must possess the
legal status of a service member or a person otherwise subject to the UCMJ before personal
jurisdiction can attach. Article 2, UCMJ, includes the following as persons subject to court-martial
jurisdiction: (1) members of a Regular Component of the U.S. Armed Forces, including those
awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; (2) cadets, aviation cadets, and
midshipmen; (3) while on inactive duty training, members of a Reserve Component and members
of the Air National Guard, but only when in Federal service; (4) retired members of a Regular
Component of the U.S. Armed Forces who are entitled to pay; (5) retired members of a Reserve
Component who are receiving hospitalization from an armed force; (6) members of the Fleet
Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve; (7) persons in custody of the U.S. Armed Forces serving
a sentence imposed by a court-martial; (8) members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Public Health Service, and other organizations, when assigned to and serving with
the Armed Forces; (9) prisoners of war in custody of the Armed Forces; (10) in time of declared
war or contingency operation, persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field; (11) subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any
accepted rule of international law, persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces outside the United States and outside the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands; (12) subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may
be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons within an area leased by or otherwise
reserved or acquired for the use of the United States which is under the control of the Secretary
concerned and which is outside the United States and outside the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands; (13) individuals belonging to one of the eight categories enumerated
in Article 4 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva
August 12, 1949, who violate the law of war. <!-- Page 411 -->

Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. Courts-martial have the power to try any offense under the UCMJ
except when prohibited from doing so by the U.S. Constitution. Courts-martial have exclusive
jurisdiction when a purely military offense, such as desertion, failure to obey orders, or disrespect
toward superiors, is involved. However, if the offense violates both the UCMJ and a civilian code, concurrent jurisdiction may exist. For example, if a RegAF military member is caught shoplifting
at an off-base merchant, the member can be tried by court-martial for larceny in violation of Article
121, UCMJ, and tried by a civilian court for a larceny offense recognized in the local jurisdiction. The determination as to whether a military or a civilian authority will try the member is normally
made through consultation or prior agreement between appropriate military authorities (ordinarily
the Staff Judge Advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities. A member to be tried by both a
court-martial and a state court for the same act is constitutionally permissible; however, a member
who has been tried by a state court normally will not be tried by court-martial for the same act. Only SecAF may approve such prosecutions, and only in the most unusual cases when the ends
of justice and discipline can be met in no other way. 21.15. Trial
When a case is referred to trial, the convening authority, generally the wing or Numbered Air Force
commander, details members in his or her opinion, who are the best qualified for the duty by reason
of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament. No members
are eligible to serve as a member of a general or special court-martial when they are the accuser or
witness for the prosecution or have acted as an investigating officer, preliminary hearing officer, or as counsel in the same case. When it can be avoided, no panel member should be junior in rank
or grade to the accused. Throughout the court-martial process, commanders, convening authorities
and all other persons subject to the UCMJ are expressly forbidden to exercise any improper
influence on the action of the court. Trial Counsel. Trial counsels are similar to prosecutors in civilian criminal trials. They represent
the government, and their objective is justice, not merely securing a conviction. Trial counsel
present evidence they believe is admissible and seek to persuade the court that the accused
committed the alleged offenses. Trial counsel argues the inferences most strongly supporting the
charges. Trial counsel also presents evidence and arguments to address defenses raised on behalf
of the accused. Trial counsel may not ethically permit the continuance of the cause of action against
the accused knowing the charges are not supported by probable cause. Additionally, trial counsel
has an affirmative duty to disclose to the defense any evidence that negates the accused’s guilt, mitigates the degree of guilt, or reasonably tends to reduce the punishment of the accused. Defense Counsel. Military defense counsel is similar to defense attorneys in civilian criminal
trials. In a trial by court-martial, the accused may be represented by military defense counsel, free
of charge. The accused may also hire a civilian lawyer at his or her own expense. An accused may
request representation by a particular military lawyer, and if that lawyer is reasonably available, he or she will be detailed to represent the accused. Defense counsel will, within the bounds of the
law, zealously represent the accused. Office of Special Trial Counsel (OSTC). Provides expert, specialized, independent, and ethical
representation of the United States, under the direct civilian control of the SecAF, in the
investigation and trial-level litigation of covered offenses, as prescribed by Article 1(17), UCMJ, and other offenses over which the office exercises authority pursuant to Article 24a, UCMJ. OSTC reports directly to SecAF with no intervening authority. Military Judge. A military trial judge presides over each open session of the court-martial. Military trial judges are selected from highly qualified, experienced judge advocates. The military

judge of a court-martial may not consult with members of the court except in the presence of the
accused, trial counsel, and defense counsel, nor does he or she vote with the members of the court. Victims’ Counsel. In addition to the brief description of the Victims’ Counsel (VC) regarding the
Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program, the USAF Judge Advocate General Corps
created the VC pilot program in 2013. Since then, it has expanded to include 101 world-wide
personnel with an independent chain of command. The VC’s primary responsibility is to his or her
client and the VC is bound by professional ethical responsibilities to him or her. VCs provide
independent legal representation, which might include opposing the government of the United
States to promote the individual interests of their clients without regard to how their actions might
otherwise affect the USAF as an institution. An VC’s legal representation includes advocacy to
relevant entities within the USAF, representation in courts-martial proceedings, post-trial and
appellate review, and advocacy or assistance regarding related matters outside the military justice
process. Findings and Sentence. The verdict of a court-martial is called the findings. An accused cannot
be found guilty unless guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A finding of guilty does not
require a unanimous agreement but requires at least three-fourths of the members to vote for a
finding of guilty. Voting is by secret written ballot. In the event of a not-guilty verdict (acquittal), the trial ends. If there is a finding of guilty, a pre-sentencing procedure follows immediately to
help the court determine an appropriate sentence. A sentence of death requires a unanimous vote
by panel members on both the findings of guilt and the propriety of death as punishment. 21.16. Appellate Review
After a sentence is announced in a court-martial, the accused may submit matters to the convening
authority for consideration in the exercise of the convening authority’s powers. Once the
convening authority takes action, the military judge of a general or special court-martial shall enter
into the record of trial the judgment of the court. The judgment reflects the result of the courtmartial, as modified by any post-trial actions, rulings, or orders. The entry of judgment terminates
the trial proceedings and initiates the appellate process. The Judge Advocate General. The Judge Advocate General is the review authority in general
court-martial cases where the sentence does not include death, dismissal, punitive discharge, or
confinement for one year or more. The Judge Advocate General may also elect to certify (refer) a
case to the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. The Judge Advocate General instructs convening
authorities to take action according to the court’s decisions. Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is the first level
of formal appellate review. It is an independent appellate judicial body of at least three military
appellate judges appointed by the Judge Advocate General. Each judge must be a member of a bar
of a federal court or of the highest court of a state and must be certified by the Judge Advocate
General as qualified by reason of education, training, experience, and judicial temperament, for
duty as an appellate military judge. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals reviews cases for
legal error and for factual sufficiency when an issue of factual sufficiency is raised by the appellant. Unless appellate review is waived by an appellant, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals
automatically reviews all cases involving a sentence that includes death, dismissal of a
commissioned officer, a punitive discharge, or confinement of two years or more. Additionally, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals reviews timely appeals submitted by an accused for
sentences to confinement greater than six months. In this forum, the appellant is provided a military
counsel (free of charge) who is an experienced trial advocate and a full-time appellate counsel. Civilian appellate counsel may be retained at the appellant’s own expense. The government is

represented by appellate government counsel. If the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals rules
against the appellant, he or she may request review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces. Note: Appellate review cannot be waived in death penalty cases. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
is composed of five civilian judges appointed by the President. It is the highest appellate court in
the military justice system. The court reviews all cases in which the death sentence was imposed, and cases previously reviewed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals forwarded on the Judge
Advocate General’s order. Review in other cases is discretionary upon petition of the appellant
and upon good cause shown. Air Force appellate defense counsel is appointed to represent the
appellant before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. If an appellant’s case is reviewed
and relief is not granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the appellant may
petition the U.S. Supreme Court for further review. U.S. Supreme Court. Decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may be
reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The accused may petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ
of certiorari (request for the lower court to send up all documents in a case for review) without
prepayment of fees and costs or security, and without filing the affidavit. Finality of Proceedings, Findings, and Sentences. The appellate review of records of trial
provided by the UCMJ; the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed as required by the UCMJ; and all dismissals and discharges carried into
execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation as required
by the UCMJ, are final and conclusive. The judgment of a court-martial, orders publishing the
proceedings of courts-martial, and all action taken pursuant to those proceedings, are binding upon
all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a
petition for a new trial under Article 73, to action by the Secretary concerned as provided in Article
74, and the authority of the U.S. President.
