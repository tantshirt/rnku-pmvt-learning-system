### Commitment to Responsibility – A Team of Teams
Many enlisted Airmen have officers or civilians as direct supervisors. There is a compelling need
for officers, civilian personnel, and enlisted Airmen to have a deliberate and common approach to
force development, career progression, and the assumption of increased supervisory and leadership
responsibilities. Each day as we execute our missions, we should all be familiar with and
understand these responsibilities and how they relate to the force structure. Our force structure, core values, foundational and occupational competencies, describe what makes us Airmen. Officer Responsibilities. The officer force structure is comprised of three distinct and separate
tiers. The tiers are Company Grade Officer with grades O-1 thru O-3, Field Grade Officer with
grades O-4 thru O-6, and General Officer, with grades of O-7 thru O-10. Progression through the
tiers correlates to increased levels of leadership and managerial responsibilities, with each tier
building on previous responsibilities and focusing on developing the appropriate tactical, operational, and strategic competencies associated with their rank and position. Therefore, General
Officers are expected to have mastered Field Grade Officer responsibilities. Likewise, Field Grade
Officers are expected to have mastered Company Grade Officer responsibilities. Above all, the
focus of each tier is leadership, professionalism, and mission success in the profession of arms. Enlisted Responsibilities. Functionally, the USAF develops technical experts through career field
progression and succession planning. Institutionally, the USAF strives to develop experienced
leaders. From the earliest stages, Airmen and supervisors must comprehend the progression path
for technical and professional development. As Airmen demonstrate expertise and potential, opportunities should be made available to encourage more responsibility and increased leadership
roles. Developmental opportunities, such as deployments, exercises, joint assignments, special
duty assignments, and headquarters staff assignments, offer unique perspectives on how the USAF
functions. Effective career progression and development are dependent upon deliberate
conversations between supervisors and subordinates regarding career field and USAF
requirements, personal qualifications, and goals. Civilian Responsibilities. The USAF Civil Service consists of more than 180,000 professional
civilians in over 35 countries. Within 11 personnel systems there are 22 career fields, 472
occupational series, and 27 different pay plans. Civilians serve in critical positions, such as
scientists, engineers, contract specialists, instructors, intelligence experts, mechanics, human
resource professionals, firefighters, aircraft mechanics, childcare providers, and many others. They
provide corporate knowledge and stability across the USAF and deploy to various contingency
areas. Civilians are fundamental to the strength of our USAF, and like the enlisted and officer
corps, have a compelling need for a deliberate and common approach to force development, career
progression, and the assumption of increased supervisory and leadership responsibilities. 7.2. Continuum of Learning
Force development generally results in leadership, management, and warrior ethos proficiency. The force development construct is a framework that links developmental needs with foundational
competencies through the continuum of learning. Occupational competency development
<!-- Page 126 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
126
generally results in technical skill proficiency. The continuum of learning, along with the defined
competencies, are aligned to ensure Airmen are qualified and ready to meet the challenges of
current and future operating environments. The continuum of learning is a career-long process of
development where challenging experiences are combined with education and training through a
common taxonomy to produce Airmen who possess the tactical expertise, operational competence, and strategic vision to lead and execute the full-spectrum of USAF missions. The three distinct levels associated with leadership skills are: tactical expertise, operational
competence, and strategic vision. These levels are recognized with varying emphasis across the
foundational competencies. As Airmen progress from tactical expertise to strategic vision
leadership levels, emphasis on the use of foundational competencies shifts to a broader focus. The
nature and scope of leadership as well as preferred leadership methods differ based on the level of
leadership and responsibilities. Tactical Expertise. Development at the tactical expertise level includes a general understanding
of team leadership and an appreciation for organization leadership. It is a time to master core duty
skills, gain experience in applying those skills, and begin acquiring knowledge and experience
essential for demonstrating effective, ethical leadership. Airmen at the tactical expertise level learn
to become the USAF’s primary technicians and specialists, assimilate into the USAF culture, and
adopt the USAF core values. The tactical expertise level is a time for honing followership abilities, motivating subordinates, and influencing peers to accomplish the mission while developing a
warrior ethos and exercising communication skills as effectively and efficiently as possible. Operational Competence. Development at the operational competence leadership level includes
developing a broader understanding of the USAF perspective and the integration of diverse
capabilities in operational execution. It is a time to transition from specialists to leaders with an
understanding of themselves as leaders and followers, while applying an understanding of
organizational and team dynamics. It is a time to lead teams by developing and inspiring others
and taking care of people. It is a time to foster collaborative relationships through building teams
and coalitions, especially within large organizations, and negotiating with others, often external to
the organization. The majority of enlisted Airmen operate at the tactical expertise and operational
competence levels. Strategic Vision. Development at the strategic vision level includes combining highly developed
personal and people/team institutional competencies, applying broad organizational competencies, and leading and directing exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations. It is a time to
develop a deep understanding of how Airmen achieve synergistic results and desired effects with
their operational capabilities. It is a time when an Airman employs military capabilities, understands the operational and strategic arts, and has a thorough understanding of unit, USAF, joint, and coalition capabilities. Development at the strategic vision level includes an enterprise
perspective with a thorough understanding of the structure and relationships needed to accomplish
strategic objectives. The strategic vision level focuses on the effects an Airman can have across
the USAF and on the Department of Defense. 7.3. Core Competencies
Core competencies are about big picture concepts that the USAF does, or is expected to do or
know, all the time. Being competent means that a person or organization has the necessary
abilities or qualities to perform or function successfully. Core competencies are a key set of
abilities or qualities at the heart of the organization’s reason for being. For the USAF, core
competencies are those special abilities and qualities we collectively possess that enable us to
function successfully and create airpower effects. Some core competencies are unique to the USAF
<!-- Page 127 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
127
and distinguish us from our sister services, while other core competencies are aligned across the
branches of service. Occupational Competencies. Occupational competencies are required of Airmen within a
specific workforce category or specialty. Occupational competencies describe technical/functional
knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform that function’s mission successfully. Refer to
AFH 36-2647, Competency Modeling, for additional details. Airman’s Foundational Competencies. Foundational competencies prepare Airmen to operate
successfully across the widest array of USAF tasks and requirements, and to adapt in a constantly
changing operational environment. They are broadly applicable across (enlisted, officer, and
civilian) USAF members, spanning all occupations, functions, and organizational levels, and form
the framework for force development in the USAF. Foundational competencies are observable, measurable patterns of knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform successfully across a
USAF career. The Foundational competencies are enduring and encompass attributes the USAF
believes are critical to mission success. The Foundational competencies are grouped into four
major categories: Developing Self, Developing Others, Developing Ideas, and Developing
Organizations. Each of these competency categories is addressed in subsequent chapters of AFH

### Enlisted Force Structure Framework
To best leverage our resources, we must have a consistent, well-defined set of expectations, standards, and growth opportunities for all Airmen, regardless of rank or specialty. The enlisted
force structure fulfills a compelling need for a deliberate and common approach to force
development, career progression, increased supervisory, and leadership responsibilities. The
enlisted force structure provides the framework to best meet mission requirements while
developing foundational and occupational competencies. It is comprised of three distinct and
separate tiers, each correlating to increased levels of education, training, and experience, which
build increasing levels of proficiency, leadership, and managerial responsibilities. 7.5. Junior Enlisted Tier
The junior enlisted tier consists of the ranks: Airman Basic, Airman, Airman First Class, and
Senior Airman. Initial enlisted accessions enter the USAF in this tier and are introduced to the
foundational competencies. They focus on adapting to the military, being part of the profession of
arms, achieving occupational proficiency, and learning to be productive members of the USAF. In
this tier, Airmen are trained, qualified, and ready to operate at home station and in an expeditionary
environment, and they prepare for increased responsibilities. Junior enlisted Airmen will progress
early in their career through the Airmanship Continuum of 100 (BMT), 200 (Technical Training)
and 300 (First-Term Airmen Center). Airman Basic and Newly Enlisted Airmen. Airmen Basic, as well as Airmen who initially enlist
in the USAF as Airman or Airman First Class, are primarily adapting to the military profession, acquiring knowledge of USAF standards, customs, courtesies, as well as striving to attain
occupational proficiency under close supervision. The written abbreviation for Airman Basic is
“AB” and the official term of address is “Airman Basic” or “Airman.”
Airman. Airmen continue learning and adapting to the military profession and are expected to
understand and conform to military standards, customs, and courtesies. An Airman begins to show
occupational proficiency at basic tasks and still requires significant supervision and support. The
written abbreviation is “Amn,” and the official term of address is “Airman.”
Airman First Class. Airmen First Class fully comply with USAF standards and devote time to
increasing skills in their career fields and the military profession while becoming effective team
members. For the Airman First Class, continued supervision is essential to ongoing occupational
and professional growth. Typically, the 5-skill level is earned at this grade. The written
abbreviation is “A1C,” and the official term of address is “Airman First Class” or “Airman.”
Senior Airman. Senior Airmen commonly perform as skilled technicians and trainers. They begin
developing supervisory and leadership skills through progressive responsibility, individual study, and mentoring. Senior Airmen strive to establish themselves as effective trainers through the
maximum use of guidance and assistance from officer and enlisted leaders. Senior Airman must
complete Airman Leadership School before assuming the grade of Staff Sergeant. The written
abbreviation is “SrA,” and the official term of address is “Senior Airman” or “Airman.”
### Noncommissioned Officer Tier
<!-- Page 129 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
129
The Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) tier consists of the ranks: Staff Sergeant and Technical
Sergeant. NCOs continue occupational growth and become expert technicians while developing
as leaders, supervisors, managers, and mentors in the profession of arms. Additionally, NCOs
ensure they keep themselves and subordinates trained, qualified, and ready to deploy and operate
at home station and in an expeditionary environment. In this tier, NCOs understand and internalize
foundational competencies in preparation for increased responsibilities while pursuing
professional development through a variety of means, including the developmental special duty
selection process and professional military education. Staff Sergeant. Staff Sergeants are skilled technicians with supervisory and training
responsibilities. Typically, the 7-skill level is earned at this rank. Staff Sergeants ensure proper use
of resources under their control for effective, efficient accomplishment of the mission. The written
Technical Sergeant. Technical Sergeants are often a unit’s technical experts. They continuously
strive to develop as technicians, supervisors, leaders, and mentors through professional
development opportunities, including professional military education. Technical Sergeants must
complete the NCO Academy before assuming the grade of Master Sergeant. The written
or “Sergeant.”
### Senior Noncommissioned Officer Tier
The Senior Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO) tier consists of the ranks: Master Sergeant, Senior
Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant. SNCOs serve as leaders in the profession of arms. They advise, supervise, mentor, and develop junior enlisted Airmen and NCOs under their charge. In this tier, SNCOs continue professional development and participate in decision-making
processes on a variety of technical, operational, and organizational issues. They have a great deal
of leadership experience to leverage resources and personnel against a variety of mission
requirements. They continue professional development through functional opportunities, professional military education, and may attend sister service or international SNCO courses. Master Sergeant. Master Sergeants are technical experts, transitioning from first-line supervisors
to leaders of operational competence. This rank carries increased responsibilities for leadership, management, and team building. Master Sergeants should consider broadening opportunities
through the developmental special duty selection process. Master Sergeants must complete the
SNCO Academy before assuming the grade of Senior Master Sergeant. The written abbreviation
Senior Master Sergeant. Senior Master Sergeants are experienced, operational leaders, skilled at
merging team talents, skills, and resources with other organizations. The written abbreviation is
Chief Master Sergeant. Chief Master Sergeants possess substantial operational and occupational
experience and hold strategic leadership positions with tremendous influence. They are charged
with mentoring and developing junior enlisted personnel and influencing the professional
development of company grade officers. All newly selected RegAF chiefs will attend the Chief
Leadership Course. Newly selected Reserve Component chiefs will attend either the Chief
the official term of address is “Chief Master Sergeant” or “Chief.”

### Enlisted Duty Titles
When properly applied, duty titles facilitate a quick understanding of a person’s role and level
of responsibility. Enlisted duty titles are assigned based upon the scope of responsibility and the
duties being performed. The following duty titles are the official, authorized duty titles for the
enlisted force. Supervisor. The title of Supervisor is used for NCO and some Senior Airmen who are first- line
supervisors, such as heavy equipment supervisors and shift supervisors. Junior enlisted Airmen
will not have the duty title of supervisor unless they are at least an Airman Leadership School
graduate and supervise the work of others. Noncommissioned Officer in Charge. The title of Noncommissioned Officer In Charge
(NCOIC), is used only for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a work center or element. NCOICs
typically have subordinate supervisors. The title of NCOIC is also used for those whose primary
duty is a unit-wide program or management function, even if they do not directly supervise
personnel. Section Chief. The title of Section Chief is used for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a section with
at least two subordinate work centers or elements. Section chiefs are typically SNCOs, and the rank
will vary depending upon the size of the section. Flight Chief. The title of Flight Chief is used for NCOs and SNCOs who are the enlisted
leaders of a flight. Flight chiefs are typically SNCOs, and the rank will vary depending upon the
size of the flight. Manager. The title of Manager, in addition to the special SNCO positions of USAF career field
managers and major command functional managers, is used for NCOs and SNCOs who are
program, project, and policy managers at designated USAF levels. They may or may not have
personnel working for them and may be the enlisted leader of the branch, division, or directorate. Chief. The title of Chief is used for Chief Master Sergeants who are program, project, or policy
managers at designated USAF levels. They may or may not have personnel working for them and
may be the enlisted leader of the branch, division, or directorate. 7.9. Selective Senior Enlisted Positions
Airmen may serve in leadership or duty positions within or outside their functional specialty. For
additional special duty positions, refer to the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. The CMSAF is the senior enlisted leader of the USAF
and takes precedence over all USAF enlisted members. The CMSAF provides leadership to the
enlisted force and advises the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense on enlisted matters for Airmen and their
families. The CMSAF communicates with the force, serves on boards and committees for
organizations affecting Airmen, testifies before Congress, and is the USAF career field manager
for command chief master sergeants and group superintendents. The CMSAF consults with sister
service senior enlisted advisors on issues affecting all enlisted members; engages with foreign
military leaders regarding theater security cooperation and partner nation development efforts; <!-- Page 131 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
131
represents the USAF to the American public, professional organizations, and media; and manages
the Air Force Order of the Sword Program. The written abbreviation is “CMSAF,” and the official
term of address is “Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force” or “Chief.” Note: Establishing a
CMSAF position was initially proposed by the Air Force Association’s Airman Advisory Council
in 1964. In 1966, Congressman Mendel Rivers introduced a bill that would mandate each of the
services to appoint one senior enlisted member. The senior enlisted member for the USAF would
serve as the senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Marine Corps had
already created the position of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in 1957, and the Army had
already created the position of Sergeant Major of the Army in 1965. Although the Rivers bill never
passed, the USAF recognized the tremendous support behind the proposal. In October 1966, Chief
of Staff of the Air Force General John P. McConnell announced the newly created position of
CMSAF. In April 1967, Chief Paul W. Airey became the first to wear the unique CMSAF insignia
with the wreath around the star. See Attachment 5, Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force, for
a photo and brief biography of all CMSAFs. Command Chief Master Sergeant. The title of Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM) applies
to the senior enlisted leader in a designated USAF level – traditionally at wings, centers, numbered
air forces (NAF), and major commands (MAJCOM). The command chief master sergeant provides
general supervision to the command’s enlisted force and is responsible for advising commanders
and staff on mission effectiveness, professional development, recognition, key enlisted Airmen
nominations and hires, accelerated promotions, performance evaluations, military readiness, training, utilization, health, morale, and welfare of the organization’s enlisted, and takes action to
address shortfalls or challenges. They also regularly visit Airmen, to include traveling to
geographically separated units/elements; interact with sister service counterparts; serve as a liaison
to and work closely with the local community and ensure the enlisted force is ready to meet mission
requirements (both in-place and deployed). RegAF command chief master sergeants serve on the
enlisted force distribution panel by advising their senior rater and panel membership on enlisted
Airmen’s potential to serve in the next higher grade. They assist and advise in the selection and
nomination of enlisted Airmen for positions of greater responsibility, to include developmental
special duties. The command chief master sergeant is the functional manager for subordinate unit’s
senior enlisted leaders and first sergeants in their organization, and performs other duties as
required/directed by their commander. Note: The titles of Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA), Senior
Enlisted Leader (SEL), and Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) are only used when holding a
designated and approved position. The equivalent to a command chief master sergeant in a
COCOM or joint task force (JTF) is a CCMD or joint task force senior enlisted leader. Approved
use of the titles of SEA and SEL are often used in joint and coalition organizational structures and
are not always synonymous with the role of a command chief master sergeant. Senior Enlisted Leader. This position serves as a key advisor in every command team and unit. The title of SEL is used for SNCOs in charge of squadron, group, and headquarters levels. These
enlisted leaders provide mentorship, guidance, experience, and expertise in organizing, equipping, training, and mobilizing the organization’s enlisted force to meet home station and expeditionary
mission requirements. RegAF SELs may support and advise commanders, directors, and fellow
enlisted leaders prior to the enlisted force distribution panel on promotion eligible Airmen’s
performance and potential to serve in the next higher grade. They also assist and advise in the
selection and nomination of enlisted Airmen for positions of greater responsibility, to include
developmental special duties. Total Force SELs manage and direct resource activities, interpret
and enforce policies and applicable directives, establish control procedures to meet mission goals
and standards, and actively support and maintain robust recognition programs. They work in
concert with other enlisted leaders, to oversee the readiness, training, health, morale, welfare, and
<!-- Page 132 -->

132
quality of life of assigned personnel. They represent the commander on all matters to support
mission and personnel readiness, to include maintaining the pulse of the enlisted force, participating on advisory councils and boards, interacting with sister-service counterparts, and
performing other duties as required/directed by the commander. First Sergeant. The First sergeant is a key leader serving in a time-honored career-broadening
position rich in custom and tradition. They epitomize the highest qualities of Air Force Senior
Noncommissioned Officers. These qualities require the First Sergeant to always to remain
perceptive and credible and to exemplify the core values of the United States Air Force. Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). The title of Enlisted AFCFM typically applies to
Chief Master Sergeants, normally located at HAF, responsible for organizing and managing one
or more enlisted career fields. Their responsibilities include establishing career field entry
requirements, managing trained personnel requirements, and developing and managing careerlong training plan requirements and programs. They also construct viable career paths, evaluate
training effectiveness, monitor health and manning of the career field, and provide input on
manning, personnel policies, and programs. AFCFMs also regularly visit Airmen, to include
traveling to geographically separated units/elements. Additionally, through the use of enlisted
development teams, they execute progression and succession planning to ensure there are
sufficient personnel and skillsets available to accomplish the mission. As functional experts, they
ensure their career fields are responsive to both current and future needs of the USAF. They rely
heavily on collaboration and communicate directly with other HAF offices on issues impacting
their career field and with their respective major command and field operating agency enlisted
career field representatives and training managers to disseminate USAF and career field policies
and program requirements. Major Command Functional Manager (MFM). The title of Enlisted MFM applies to SNCOs
who manage designated enlisted career fields and serve as the major command liaisons for their
respective AFCFMs. They regularly visit organizations in the major command they oversee, monitor the health and manning of their career fields within their command, and elevate concerns
to the AFCFMs. They manage command training for their career field and coordinate command
training and personnel issues across their major command staff and with AFCFMs. They
disseminate USAF and career field policies and program requirements affecting their career field
throughout the major command. They coordinate with the Air Force Personnel Center (RegAF
only), through their major command, to ensure proper command prioritization of allocated and
assigned personnel resources. They provide functional and subject matter expertise to training
managers to develop new or modify/improve existing training programs. <!-- Page 133 -->

### Enlisted Force Development Construct
Enlisted force development combines training, education, and experience in a life-cycle approach
to developing innovative Airmen prepared to accomplish the USAF mission and lead in a rapidly
evolving global environment. Deliberate development is essential throughout an Airman’s career
and is satisfied through education on foundational competencies, training on occupational
competencies, seeking a varied array of experiential opportunities, and utilizing additional force
developmental tools for continued growth to meet both personal and professional needs. As
developing Airmen, it is essential to take full advantage of the abundant opportunities and
resources that exist both in a specialty and across the USAF. What is imperative from an enterprise
perspective, is looking at how Airmen progress through their careers to successfully assume the
responsibilities required in operational and strategic leadership positions. Enlisted Development Teams. Enlisted development teams are designed to leverage the
development of qualified Airmen with the leadership capacity and acculturation necessary to
support current and projected mission requirements. Career field managers use enlisted
development teams to perform progression and succession planning to place Airmen in key
leadership and developmental positions based on defined education, training, experience, and
performance requirements. Placing the right people in the right place at the right time is imperative. Enlisted Force Development Panel. The Enlisted Force Development Panel is responsible for
guiding enlisted force development initiatives. The panel is charged with reviewing, evaluating, and making recommendations to senior USAF leaders regarding education, training, and
experiences impacting enlisted development. Panel members include command chief master
sergeants, career field managers, as well as representatives from Air Education and Training
Command, Air Force Personnel Center, and HAF. Air Force Senior Enlisted Leadership Council. The Air Force Senior Enlisted Leadership
Council is responsible for addressing deliberate development initiatives for Airmen with regard to
opportunities for enhanced performance. The council is comprised of chief master sergeants
serving in strategic/joint/combined commands, major command command chiefs, other senior
enlisted leader, and selected advisors. Efforts of the council aim to elevate the caliber and
performance of enlisted Airmen, develop solutions to the highest priority issues and opportunities
for Airmen and families, counsel and advise the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of
the Air Force, and senior USAF commanders and leaders. Air Force Enlisted Council. The Air Force Enlisted Council is comprised of the current 12
Outstanding Airmen of the Year. With mentorship and oversight of the Air Force Senior Enlisted
Leadership Council, the Air Force Enlisted Council serves as enlisted ambassadors for USAF
enlisted recruiting and retention efforts. The council also actively engages with the Air Force
Association, enlisted professional military education, and various enlisted USAF organizations. MyVECTOR. MyVECTOR is a Total Force, experience tracking, enterprise solution, that
supports USAF development priorities. MyVECTOR is a web-based career planning and force
development tool that allows individuals greater transparency into their development and career
management. In addition to being the enterprise information technology tool used to support career
field managers and development teams, MyVECTOR also offers robust mentoring capabilities. <!-- Page 134 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
134
The modern online platform offers configuration, supporting not only the traditional by-name
method of requesting a mentor, but also providing a mentor-matching capability based on weighted
characteristics identified by Airmen searching for a mentor. MyVECTOR offers a real-time
mentoring plan, discussion forums, a bullet tracker to document accomplishments, and the ability
to dialogue on-line with a mentor. MyVECTOR also includes a Developmental Special Experience (DSE) Catalog in the
Development Plan section. DSEs provide hands-on experiences that are typically outside of AFSC
or career series formal training, and help individuals gain or enhance competencies. Unlike
assignment systems, the Catalog lists all DSEs, regardless of vacancies or application windows, to
make users aware of all requirements or prerequisites. MyVECTOR additionally offers a developmental self-assessment that helps members identify
their personal strengths and areas for improvement among the USAF Foundational Competencies. The self-assessment provides immediate feedback on recommended online resources (e.g., videos, articles, courses) based on a member’s identified areas for improvement. To further selfawareness, members also have the option to use the assessment tool to request confidential
feedback from their supervisors and/or subordinates, peers, or higher-ranking members (360degree feedback). Airmen can access the full searchable library of online resources (e.g., videos, (e.g., Teamwork, articles, courses) associated with each
Communication, Resilience) at any time to further personal and professional development. foundational competency
Talent Management. Our USAF culture should attract the right Airmen, professionals ready to
represent the world’s greatest USAF. Talent management begins with recruiting and is continued
through training and education, where it is cultivated. The USAF’s ability to continue to respond
faster than our adversaries rely on the flexibility and adaptability of our Airmen. Not only do we
want to be innovators, but our nation also depends on it. The way we manage talent directly impacts
the way we fight and win wars. The system that is designed to manage people must be as agile as
we expect our Airmen to be. Competitive Edge. The USAF as an institution recognizes the importance of an innovative and
agile work environment for maintaining a competitive edge and being considered an employer of
choice for our nation’s best and brightest talent. Training and education are steadily becoming more
aligned with capitalizing on talents of those within the USAF. USAF programs are designed to
develop, manage, and execute realistic and flexible training and education to produce a highly
skilled, motivated force that is capable of carrying out all tasks and functions in support of the
USAF mission. Innovative Airmen power the force. To keep pace, we must continuously
modernize our education and training to be relevant and responsive. The unpredictable landscape
we operate in requires the USAF to continue to revisit, improve, and evolve our personnel
management processes to ensure we retain our talented Airmen. While some initiatives are forcewide and others are more targeted, they all have the same objective - to increase our competitive
position for top talent. 7.11. Occupational Analysis Program
Air Education and Training Command, Studies and Analysis Squadron, houses the USAF
Occupational Analysis Program, governed by DAFMAN 36-2664, Personnel Assessment
Program. The purpose of the program is to equip senior leaders and managers of USAF personnel
and education and training programs with objective, fact-based information about USAF
occupations and civilian occupational series. The role of occupational analysis is to conduct
occupational studies, develop survey instruments, analyze data collected, and provide actionable
USAF specialty information. <!-- Page 135 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
135
As noted in AFPD 36-26, the Occupational Analysis Program is the singularly unique USAF entity
which collects, analyzes, and reports the job/occupational performance factors which are defined, measured, and applied within instructional system development. Consequently, the Occupational
Analysis Program is integral to providing an objective and factual orientation for three force
development tenets inherent in force development: training, utilization, and promotions. Training. Capabilities-based training is used to identify knowledge needed and specific tasks
necessitating training to meet job performance requirements. Utilization. Personnel classification and utilization is used to identify tasks performed at each
career stage and to validate occupational structures. Promotions. Promotion testing is used to identify operationally relevant content for test
development and promoting and retaining the best Airmen. Occupational Analysis Process. Occupational Analysis conducts occupational studies on enlisted
USAF specialties on a periodic basis, typically a three- to four-year cycle, and upon request if out
of cycle. Special studies, such as officer USAF specialties and civilian occupational series, are also
conducted upon request. Career field leaders and subject matter experts are key to the process in
developing the content of occupational survey instruments. Occupational surveys are administered
to all eligible personnel in the targeted specialty or civilian occupational series through direct email (AFNet). Occupational Analysis Data. Occupational survey results are provided in occupational analysis
reports that include information on the duties and responsibilities performed by career field
members in the form of task statements and duty areas throughout each stage of their career. Decision-makers associated with training programs use the data obtained to establish, validate, adjust, or maintain training relative to USAF specialties and skill-levels, and to support decisions
on what type of training is needed, who needs the training, and to what depth the training should be
taught. All career field members have pivotal roles with the constructive outcomes of occupational studies. Airmen of a career field being surveyed must devote the necessary time and commitment in
completing their assigned occupational surveys. The data collected from each survey participant
translates into operationally relevant training programs for their USAF specialty, and fair and
reliable promotion tests for their career field under Weighted Airman Promotion System. Occupational analysis serves as an external evaluation mechanism for USAF education and
training programs. Occupational analysis data is used during specialty training requirements, team
sessions, and utilization and training workshops to evaluate training requirements for relevancy
and efficacy, and to determine if modifications are warranted to their Career Field Education and
Training Plans; Career Development Course content; and the USAF specialty descriptions of
duties, responsibilities, and qualifications. To view career field information and gain valuable
insights into the duties and responsibilities of career fields across the USAF, visit the Occupational
information
Analysis (https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/aetc-hq/A9/SAS/OA/) website. Additional
provided on the website includes job satisfaction information, work-life balance data, and the
rationale behind why Airmen are reenlisting or separating from the USAF. <!-- Page 136 -->

### Training Opportunities
Training is something every Airman needs throughout their career, from basic military training
to technical training, to advanced skill level training, and beyond. This need costs the USAF
millions of dollars annually, and for good reason. To accomplish the mission, whether that means
sending satellites into orbit, planes in the air, reports to higher headquarters, or vehicles on the
road, training is a must. 7.13. Basic Military Training
All enlisted Airmen are trained in the fundamental skills necessary to be successful in the USAF. These skills include basic combat skills, field training exercises, weapons training, military
discipline, physical fitness, drill and ceremonies, dormitory inspections, history and heritage, core
values, and a comprehensive range of subjects relating to USAF life, such as financial
management, family issues, and alcohol/substance abuse. More than seven million young men and
women have entered USAF basic military training. Basic military training begins with the
receiving phase (zero week) and ends with graduation. Military training instructors are responsible
for most of the training that takes place, and they accompany trainees throughout the training
process. Following graduation, all Airmen proceed to the appropriate technical training school or
their first duty assignment. Technical training typically lasts anywhere from one month to two
years, depending on the Airman’s assigned Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). 7.14. On-the-Job Training
The USAF on-the-job training (OJT) provides personnel the opportunity to attain knowledge and
skill qualifications required to perform duties in their specialty. Effective training, knowledge, proficiency, and experience are integral parts of a unit’s mission that will ultimately lead to a
successful career and contribute to a solid national defense. An effective OJT program requires
commander and supervisory involvement at all levels. While the supervisor’s primary
responsibility is to plan OJT that outlines specific short-term, mission-related goals for the trainee, overall success depends on the supervisor’s ability to advise and actively assist Airmen in reaching
their long-range career objectives. The USAF OJT program consists of three components: job
knowledge, job proficiency, and job experience. Job Knowledge. Job knowledge is satisfied through a planned program of study involving Career
Development Courses (CDC) or technical references listed in the Career Field Education and
Training Plan (CFETP) or identified by the supervisor. Job Proficiency. Job proficiency is hands-on training provided on the job, allowing the trainee to
gain proficiency in tasks performed in the work center. Job Experience. Job experience is gained during and after upgrade training to build confidence
and competence. 7.15. Upgrade Training
Upgrade training leads to award of higher skill levels and is designed to increase skills and abilities. AFSC upgrade training requirements for award of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels are outlined AFMAN
36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification, DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program, and the
<!-- Page 137 -->

137
applicable CFETP. Apprentice. Airmen must complete an initial skills course for award of the 3-skill level. Retraining
into an AFSC may be accomplished via OJT training alone, only when specified in the retraining
instructions and as approved by the career field manager or the career field functional manager
(Air Reserve Component). Personnel retraining via OJT may be awarded a 3-skill level when they
complete knowledge training on all tasks taught in the initial skills course and other tasks and
mandatory requirements. Journeyman. Airmen must complete mandatory CDCs, if available, and applicable mandatory
core tasks identified in the CFETP. Award of the 5-skill level also requires completion of all
mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). Additionally, the member must be recommended by the supervisor and approved by the
commander. Individuals in retraining status (Training Status Code F) are subject to the same
training requirements. Craftsman. To be a craftsman, the member must be at least a Staff Sergeant Select; complete
mandatory CDCs, if available, and complete applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the
CFETP. Award of the 7-skill level also requires completion of a 7-skill level craftsman course (if
career field requires it) and mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD. Additionally, the
member must be recommended by the supervisor and approved by the commander. Individuals in
retraining status (Training Status Code G) are subject to the same training requirements. Superintendent. For award of the 9-skill level, the member must be at least a Senior Master
Sergeant, meet mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD, be recommended by the supervisor, and be approved by the commander. 7.16. Unit Training Management
The unit training program is designed to ensure all Airmen receive quality, standardized, comprehensive training. The trainee is the focal point of the training program, while at the
forefront, unit training managers and supervisors work together to plan, conduct, and evaluate the
trainees’ efforts to become qualified to perform in their USAF specialty. The success and quality
of training greatly depends on the trainee’s active participation and understanding of the training
program, as well as the relationship between the supervisor, trainer, and trainee. Basic
requirements of the unit training program state that newly assigned personnel will be interviewed
within 30 days (60 days for Air Reserve Component) to determine training status and issue CDCs
upon confirmation within the Course Development Student Administration Record System. Work center training orientation will be conducted within 60 days of assignment (120 days for Air
Reserve Component); a comprehensive trainee orientation will be conducted for trainees initially
entering upgrade training within 60 days of assignment (90 days for Air Reserve Component); and
a training progress review will be conducted with the unit training manager, supervisor, and trainee
at the 24th month of upgrade training (36th month for ANG) and at least every 90 days thereafter
until the trainee is upgraded or withdrawn from training. Before being submitted for upgrade, the
trainee must meet all mandatory requirements as defined in the CFETP, AFECD, and the Air Force
Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS). Unit Training Managers. Unit training managers are the commander’s key staff members
responsible for overall management of the training program. Training managers serve as training
consultants to all unit members and determine if quality training programs are in effect within all
sections. Training managers develop, manage, and conduct training in support of in-garrison and
expeditionary mission requirements; advise and assist commanders and unit personnel in executing
<!-- Page 138 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
138
their training responsibilities; and conduct a staff assistance visit of the unit’s training program to
include geographically separated units, every two years (ARC three years), or sooner if requested
by the unit commander. Supervisors. In addition to unit training managers, supervisors have the single greatest impact on
mission accomplishment with regard to training. They must share their experiences and expertise
with trainees to meet mission requirements and ensure a quality training program is provided. Supervisors develop one work center master task list (MTL) that ensures completion of all duty
position requirements (i.e., 100 percent task coverage) and conduct a review annually. The
supervisor must also integrate training with day-to-day work center operations and consider trainer
and equipment availability, training opportunities, and schedules. Trainers. The trainer (often the trainee’s supervisor) is selected based on their experience and
their ability to provide instruction to the trainee. Additionally, they must maintain task
qualification and complete the USAF training course. Trainer responsibilities include planning, conducting, and documenting training; preparing and using teaching outlines or task breakdowns; developing evaluation tools; and briefing the trainee and supervisor on the training evaluation
results. Task Certifiers. Task certifiers provide third-party certification and evaluation of progress in the
training program. Certifiers must be at least a Staff Sergeant with a 5-skill level or civilian
equivalent, complete the USAF training course, and be capable of evaluating the task being
certified. Certifiers will develop evaluation tools or use established training evaluation methods to
determine the trainee’s abilities and training program effectiveness, and will brief the trainee, supervisor, and trainer on evaluation results. 7.17. Training Forms and Documentation
Training documentation is important to personnel at all levels because it validates the status of
training and task qualification. Documentation also helps managers assess mission capability and
readiness, and it defines requirements for individual career progression. Department of the Air Force Form 623, Individual Training Record. The DAF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, six-part folder (when required by the career field manager), or approved electronic equivalent, is generated for all trainees entering upgrade training for the
first time. The training record reflects past and current qualifications and is used to determine
training requirements. Supervisors maintain the training record, and ensure it is available to
applicable personnel in the chain of command, including the unit training manager, upon request. Unless classified, the training record is returned to the member upon separation, retirement, commissioning, promotion to Master Sergeant, or as otherwise directed by the career field
manager. Department of the Air Force Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet. Use DAF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, or automated
version, to document an individual’s training progress. The form reflects status, counseling, and breaks in training. Career Field Education and Training Plan. The CFETP is a comprehensive core document
identifying life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, core and
home station training, and deployment/unit type code task requirements for USAF specialties. Supervisors use the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage, and execute training within the career field
and to identify and certify all past and current qualifications. CFETP Part I provides information
necessary for overall management of the specialty and is maintained as part of the work center
<!-- Page 139 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
139
master training plan. CFETP Part II contains the specialty training standard identifying the duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, core and home station training tasks, deployment/unit type code tasks, and CDC requirements. At least one copy of the entire CFETP
(Part I and II), should be kept in the work center for general access. Electronic copy is authorized
if CFETP is in automated system. AFCFMs are responsible to ensure their respective CFETP embodies Airmanship and
incorporates the following competencies that align with the Air Force foundational competencies: communication, accountability, teamwork, analytical thinking, and resource management. Air Force Job Qualification Standard. The AFJQS is a training document approved by the career
field manager for a particular job type or duty position within a USAF specialty. Department of the Air Force Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations. Evaluators use the DAF
Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations, to conduct and document completion of task evaluations
during training staff assistance visits, when directed by the commander, or when task certification
requires validation. Completed evaluations conducted on a single trainee by the supervisor/trainer
or task certifier are filed in DAF Form 623, Individual Training Record, until upgraded or no
longer applicable. Unit training managers maintain task evaluations performed during SAVs with
the completed report. Department of the Air Force Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command
JQS. DAF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, is a continuation
of the CFETP Part II, or AFJQS. This form defines locally assigned duty position, home station
training, and deployment/unit type code requirements not included in the CFETP, Part II. Department of the Air Force Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training. Supervisors use the DAF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, to
document selected tasks requiring recurring training or evaluation. USAF and major command
directives may identify tasks contained in the CFETP that require special certification, as well as
recurring training or evaluations. 7.18. Retraining Program
The retraining program is designed to balance the number of personnel in specific grades and year
groups of a USAF specialty. Once retraining is approved and the Airman has been assigned duty
in the new specialty, upgrade training begins. With minor exceptions, training requirements are
identical for retrainees and standard upgrade trainees. Refer to AFMAN 36-2100, Military
Utilization and Classification, for additional details. 7.19. Language Enabled Airman Program
The Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) (https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/AFCLC/), designed and managed by the USAF Culture and Language Center at Air University, Maxwell
Air Force Base, Alabama, provides opportunities for officers and enlisted Airmen in the general
purpose force (GPF) who have outstanding service records and possess some level of skill in a
foreign language, as measured by the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) or Oral
Proficiency Interview (OPI). LEAP is a highly competitive, board-selected program that enables
the USAF to sustain, deliberately develop, and posture Airmen for utilization in language
designated positions, deployments, and other CCMD requirements. Selected members develop
and professionalize their skills through an online synchronous platform called “eMentor” and
through periodic overseas language immersions. <!-- Page 140 -->

## Section 7F — Professional Military Education B B C C C

### Education Opportunities
Educational opportunities exist throughout an Airman’s career which contribute to individual
overall development. Professional Military Education (PME) enhances performance in each phase
of professional development and builds upon the foundation of leadership abilities developed
during the earlier stages of an individual’s career. PME complements training, experience, and
other educational programs to provide enlisted leaders a continuum of learning via progressive
courses concentrated on developing leadership, Airmanship, and military professionalism. PME
courses provide professional education to enlisted Airmen to ensure development of USAF
institutional competencies and subcompetencies vital to the knowledge and skills required for
critical thinking, sound decision-making, and a strategic mindset. For additional information about
USAF PME programs and policies, refer to DAFI 36-2670. 7.21. Enlisted Professional Military Education
In 1955, enlisted PME schools were established across the USAF to provide non-commissioned
officers leadership and management training required to assume day-to-day mission execution
responsibilities. The stand-up of these schools coincided with the release of the first official
enlisted force structure which established the leadership roles and responsibilities of enlisted
Airmen at each grade. Operational control of stateside enlisted PME schools lies with Air
Education and Training Command at the Thomas N. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, located
at Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, Alabama. The Barnes Center, Academic Affairs is responsible for developing and providing enlisted PME
program development, faculty development, and operational program management. Barnes Center
programs consist of academic courses that use performance evaluations and objective
examinations to determine how well students achieve instructional objectives. Courses are
designed with principle instructional methods, experiential activities, problem-centered leadership
laboratories, personal reflection, guided discussion, case study analysis, and writing assignments. Note: With the exception of the Chief Leadership Course, Airmen are awarded collegiate
academic credit for completing enlisted PME courses through the Community College of the Air
Force, which is accredited through Air University by the Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools Commission on Colleges. Airman Leadership School Distance Learning. The Airman Leadership School Distance
Learning (ALS-DL) Course provides PME to prepare Senior Airmen to supervise and foster a
commitment to the military profession. The ALS-DL curriculum is designed to develop a mindset
and associated skills with respect to four core attributes: (1) professional Airmen, (2) expeditionary
Airmen, (3) supervisor of Airmen, and (4) supervisory communicator. The ALS-DL course is open
to Air National Guard and USAF Reserve Senior Airmen and Staff Sergeants. The course is not
available for RegAF personnel. Students must pass two course exams by attaining the minimum
passing score on each exam. Airman Leadership School Blended Learning. In October 2016, the Airman Leadership School
launched the Blended Learning Course (ALS-BLC), which combines distance learning principles
with traditional classroom learning. ALS-BLC is divided into two phases. Phase I is eight weeks
long and delivered by utilizing an online learning management system. Students complete core

academic work in an asynchronous environment. Phase II is two weeks long and conducted at the
Paul H. Lankford PME Center located on McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base, Tennessee. The ALS-BLC curriculum is designed to develop a mindset and associated skills with respect to
four core attributes: (1) professional Airmen, (2) expeditionary Airmen, (3) supervisor of Airmen, and (4) supervisory communicator. Airman Leadership School. Airman Leadership School (ALS) is the first level of enlisted PME
that Airmen complete as they progress through their USAF careers. ALS is offered at almost every
installation across the USAF and is designed to prepare Senior Airmen to be professional
warfighting Airmen, able to supervise and lead USAF teams to support the employment of air
and cyberspace power. The first level of ALS is the distance learning course (ALS-DL). ALS-DL
includes: (1) professional Airmen, (2) expeditionary Airmen, (3) supervisor of Airmen, and (4)
supervisory communicator. The ALS curriculum includes: (1) mission, (2) leadership, (3) problem
solving, and (4) USAF culture. Noncommissioned Officer Distance Learning. The Noncommissioned Officer Distance
Learning (NCO-DL) course is open to Air Reserve Component Airmen. The NCO-DL Course
provides PME for basic NCO institutional competency development required to prepare enlisted
leaders to be professional, warfighting Airmen and Guardians who can lead and manage USAF
units in the employment of air and space power. The NCO-DL course consists of three course
modules: (1) course foundation, (2) leadership and management, and (3) operational Airman. The
NCO-DL course is open to Air Reserve Component Airmen. To successfully complete this course, students are required to pass three course exams, demonstrating curriculum mastery by attaining
the minimum passing score on each exam. Furthermore, EPME Distance Learning Courses (DLC)
completion is no longer a prerequisite for resident attendance effective 26 April 2018. Additionally, Air University will no longer allow new enrollments for active component Airmen. Airmen may access EPME DLC for reference purposes only through the Air University Student
Information System (AUSIS). Noncommissioned Officer Academy. The NCO Academy (NCOA) mission is to prepare enlisted
leaders for current and future leadership and management opportunities to operate (think and act)
critically in complex and ambiguous environments. The NCOA program encompasses the
intermediate leadership experience, which includes guided discussions, experiential exercises, case study analysis, and immersive leadership development laboratories designed to improve an
NCO’s competence, confidence, and will to exercise assigned leadership responsibilities. Senior Noncommissioned Officer Distance Learning. This course is open to Air Reserve
Component Airmen. The Senior Noncommissioned Officer Distance Learning (SNCO-DL)
Course provides institutional competency development required to prepare SNCOs to lead the
enlisted force at the tactical and operational levels. The curriculum’s design heightens students’
appreciation and understanding of three attributes: (1) self-awareness, (2) leadership and
management, and (3) joint warfighter. This course is open to Air Reserve Component Airmen. To
successfully complete the course, students are required to demonstrate curriculum mastery by
attaining the minimum passing score on each of three module exams. Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy. The SNCO Academy (SNCOA) trains up to 2,250
USAF, Navy, Coast Guard, Marine, and international SNCOs, annually. The SNCOA mission is
to develop joint and coalition senior enlisted leaders to influence mission success in dynamic
service environments. The SNCOA program encompasses the advanced leadership experience, representing comprehensive institutional competency development. The SNCOA is designed to
sharpen senior enlisted leader skills with education that helps prepare them for continued and
increased relevant responsibilities in joint, combined, interagency, and strategic environments. <!-- Page 142 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Chief Leadership Course. The Chief Leadership Course (CLC) is the capstone and pinnacle level
of enlisted PME. Currently, the CLC provides newly selected Chief Master Sergeants with
foundational, strategic-level leadership competencies. The CLC conducts seven classes per year, educating 750 Total Force Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects annually. The CLC mission is to provide chiefs the education to bridge operational-to-strategic perspectives
of the Air Force. The CLC vision is to develop chiefs into strategic level leaders and to inspire
them to effectively lead, manage, and mentor today's Airmen. The CLC demands extensive selfstudy, critical creative thinking, communication, and interpersonal skills. 7.22. Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education
In addition to enlisted PME courses, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI)
1805.01B, Enlisted Professional Military Education Policy, requires all enlisted personnel
operating in joint, interagency, multinational, and coalition warfighting organizations to learn joint
concepts. Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (EJPME) provides SNCOs a
comprehensive joint education to prepare them for assignments to joint billets at the senior
enlisted leader or command senior enlisted leader level. EJPME is web-based and is designed to
expose enlisted personnel to joint education, prepare them to succeed by improving their ability
to operate effectively and supervise multiple service members. EJPME courses are offered online
and are accessible from anywhere at any time. EJPME consists of two courses of instruction referred to as EJPME I and II. EJPME I emphasizes
curriculum commensurate with E-5/E-7 joint assignment responsibilities. EJPME II is focused on
preparing E-7/E-9 enlisted members for their senior leadership roles in joint assignments. EJPME
I and II have learning areas and objectives in: (1) national strategic overview; (2) joint interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational capabilities; (3) foundations of joint operations; and (4) Joint
Force leadership. Note: Students must complete rank-required service enlisted PME before
enrolling in EJPME. 7.23. International Professional Military Education
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Security cooperation, under the Department of Defense
guidance, leads national security objective efforts to train, educate, advise, and equip foreign
partners. Department of Defense policy states that security cooperation, as an important tool of
national security and foreign policy, shall be planned, programmed, budgeted, and executed with
the same high degree of attention and efficiency as other integral Department of Defense activities. Inter-American Air Forces Academy. In addition to enlisted and joint PME, Air Education and
Training Command hosts the Inter-American Air Forces Academy (IAAFA), an organization
designed to focus on education, training, and security cooperation. IAAFA was initially established
as a training program on 15 March 1943, at the request of Peru's Minister of Aeronautics, General
Fernando Melgar. The Academy trained 11 Peruvian students in support of Allied unity in the
western hemisphere at Albrook Air Force Station, Panama Canal Zone, marking the first United
States aeronautics training in Latin America. Today, as an element of the U.S. Security Assistance
Program, and more specifically the International Military Education and Training Program, IAAFA has provided significant contributions to promote regional stability, encourage the growth
of democracy, prevent low intensity conflicts, and counter foreign intervention in Central America. Since its inception, IAAFA has served as a military training center for Latin American Air Forces
by training military forces, national police services, and civilian personnel from over 25 nations in
areas ranging from PME for officers and enlisted personnel, security forces training, principles of
logistics, aircraft maintenance, and pilot aviation training. IAAFA has served a variety of national
interests in the Latin America region, ranging from support of United States-Allied efforts in
<!-- Page 143 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
143
World War II, to Counterinsurgency/Civic Action actions during the Alliance for Progress era, to
current national and security policies in support of democracy, individual freedoms, and human
rights. IAAFA’s mission is to provide military education and training to military personnel of the
Americas and other eligible partner nations and its vision is to strengthen partnerships that advance
shared interests and enable partner nations to act in support of aligned strategic objectives. The
Academy integrates USAF and guest instructors from different partner nations as critical enablers
to provide the highest quality of in-residence training, mobile training, and a virtual learning
environment to support of our Latin American partners from Central, South America, and
Caribbean nations. Currently located at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, IAAFA
graduates an average of 900 students annually, it has graduated over 35,000 students in its 75-year
history, and it allocates the only PME center in the USAF with the capability of offering the three
enlisted tiers of professional military education (Airman Leadership School, Noncommissioned
Officer Academy and Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy). Inter-European Air Forces Academy. The Inter-European Air Forces Academy (IEAFA) was
passed into U.S. law in the Public Law 106-291, Section 1268, Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck”
McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, 19 December 2014. In 2017, IEAFA was codified as a permanent authority to train and educate partner nations. The purpose
of IEAFA is to provide military education and training to military personnel of countries that are
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or signatories to the Partnership for
Peace (PfP) Framework Documents. IEAFA's mission is to enable combined, joint air operations
by strengthening NATO and PfP air force capabilities and interoperability through targeted
military education and training. The Academy was officially activated on 23 March 2016, and is subordinate to Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe & Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), and the Warrior
Preparation Center located at Einsiedlerhof Air Station, Germany. Since its establishment, IEAFA
has educated and trained more than 500 students from 32 countries. With PME as the Academy's
primary focus, IEAFA's unique approach develops officers and NCOs in a combined learning
environment, integrating the learning experience between the ranks, thus showcasing the benefit
of a professional working relationship and how it drives mission success. Additionally, IEAFA is
expanding its technical training course offerings to boost partnership capacity in the European
theater for specific disciplines, which in-turn strengthens NATO and enables successful combined
air operations. <!-- Page 144 -->

### Community College of the Air Force Program
The USAF has always recognized the positive effects of education on USAF personnel and
continually established various programs to meet the needs of the USAF, its enlisted Airmen, and
society as a whole. One of the most notable programs is the Community College of the Air Force
(CCAF), https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Barnes/CCAF/. Legacy. The CCAF was activated in 1972 to gain academic recognition for formal technical
training conducted by USAF schools. By the mid-1970s, many civilian consultants reported that
CCAF standards exceeded the minimum requirements of civilian community college associate
degree programs and the USAF sought degree-granting authority from Congress. President Gerald
r. Ford signed Public Law 94-361, 94th Congress, An Act, on 14 July 1976 authorizing the
Commander of Air Training Command (currently Air Education and Training Command) to
confer the associate of applied science degree. The Commander of Air Education and Training
Command remained CCAF’s degree-granting authority until 28 October 2004. On that date, degree-granting authority changed to the Commander of Air University when President George
w. Bush signed the Public Law 108–375, Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The CCAF administrative center is located at Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, Alabama. It is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only
community college system within the Department of Defense and two-year institution exclusively
serving enlisted personnel. Over the years the College has grown both in numbers and recognition
as the largest multi-campus community college system in the world. Today, more than 6,500
CCAF faculty deliver more than 2,000 credit-awarding courses at more than 100 affiliated school
campuses worldwide to more than 270,000 students. Each year more than 1.6 million semester
hours of collegiate credit are earned in CCAF classrooms. More than one million official
transcripts have been issued in the last 10 years. Since its first degree in 1977, more than 580,000
CCAF associate of applied science degrees have been awarded. Mission. Provide enlisted professionals pathways to degrees and credentials through military
education, training, and experience. CCAF awards the associate of applied science degree to total
force enlisted Airmen. The college offers associate of applied science degree programs in four
broad career groups: (1) operations, (2) logistics, (3) medical, and (4) support. Accreditation. The Department of Education defines accreditation as, “the recognition that an
institution maintains standards requisite for its graduates to gain admission to other reputable
institutions of higher learning or to achieve credentials for professional practice.” The goal of
accreditation is to ensure that education provided by institutions of higher learning meets
acceptable standards. In the United States, an institution’s accreditation is a major method for
students, government officials, employers, and academic institutions to know that an institution
provides quality education. CCAF is a part of Air University. Air University is accredited by the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award the associate, master’s, and doctoral
degrees. The associate degree from CCAF is awarded under the authority of Air University. Associate of Applied Science Degree. Associate degrees earned in professional, technical, or
terminal programs are frequently called associate of applied science degrees. The educational
<!-- Page 145 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
145
standard for the associate of applied science degree is designed for students who plan to seek
employment based upon the competencies and skills attained through these programs and to offer
the academic, technical, and professional knowledge and skills required for job acquisition, retention, and advancement. While not designed to meet the needs of students who transfer to a
four-year institution, portions of these programs often do so. The CCAF offers and awards the associate of applied science degree through a combination of
collegiate credit earned through completed formal technical training courses delivered at CCAF
affiliated schools and courses completed at accredited civilian colleges or credit by examination. Since enlisted Airmen are constantly relocating in performance of their duties, the CCAF provides
a means of completing degree requirements regardless of location of assignment. Enlisted Airmen are automatically registered in the CCAF associated of applied science degree
program designed for their USAF specialty near their completion of basic military training. Effective with the 2022-2024 CCAF General Catalog, degree graduates must complete the 60
semester-hour academic requirements, hold at least the Journeyman 5-skill level or equivalent, have a minimum of 9 semester hours of CCAF institutional credit in degree-applicable Technical
Education (non-Military Technology and Applied Sciences Management), and have a minimum
of 15 semester hours of CCAF institutional credit applied overall. Commonly known as
“Residency”, institutional credit is credit earned from CCAF credit-awarding courses. Table 7.1. specifies the educational requirements for the typical CCAF associate of applied science degree

by non-CCAF faculty are not certified by CCAF and are not awarded CCAF academic credit. The
CCAF General Catalog (https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CCAF/documents/20222024_CCAF_General_Catalog-Change1.pdf) provides policy information concerning acceptance
of course credit in- transfer from other accredited colleges and professional credentialing credit for
application toward specific degree programs. Air University Student Information System (AUSIS). The AUSIS provides students with
timely and accurate academic information pertaining to CCAF Associate of Applied Science
degree program progression. This web-based resource is accessible via weblink or from the Air
Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC), enabling students to view their CCAF degree audit, also known as the student progress report. Air University Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative Program. The Air University
Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC) program (https://afvec.us.af.mil/afvec/auabc/welcome) links CCAF associate of applied science degree programs to accredited four-year

Professional Credentialing Programs. Just like higher-education, professional credentialing is
an important element of force development as it provides up-to-date industry-recognized
credentials applicable to USAF occupations. CCAF offers credentialing programs to assist
enlisted Airmen in broadening their professional development. Credentialing directly supports the
mission of the CCAF in that credentialing of enlisted Airmen enhances combat readiness, contributes to recruiting and retention, and supports career transitions. To support documentary
evidence of training, skills, and practical experience, Airmen are highly encouraged to maintain
records of all previous and current education, training, and qualifications. Joint Service Aviation Maintenance Technician Certification Council (JSAMTCC). The
CCAF offers the JSAMTCC Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) program to Aviation Maintenance
Technicians (AMT) in specific Military Occupational Classifications (MOC) across the DoD and
the USCG, which streamlines the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) A&P certification
process for military members who hold or have held those MOCs. The program is designed to
bridge gaps between military AMT’s formal technical training, upgrade training, and experience
and FAA certification eligibility requirements. Upon successful completion of the program, the
CCAF provides the necessary documents to meet FAA eligibility and provides authorization to
take the A&P exams, eliminating the FAA Flight Standards District Office preauthorization
process. The program benefits the joint force by broadening the skillsets and professional
development of military AMTs, producing a more well-rounded and diverse aircraft maintenance
professional. Agreements with the FAA allow military testing sites to administer FAA certification
knowledge exams free of charge to all who are eligible. <!-- Page 147 -->

### Enhanced Education Opportunities
Certifications and post-secondary degrees, to include associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or other
advanced academic degrees, are important for professional development to the extent that they
enhance the degree holder’s job and professional qualifications. Members should focus on
enhancing professional competence while expanding their operational employment of air and
cyberspace knowledge. Certifications and degrees directly related to an individual’s primary
specialty area or occupational series adds to the depth of job knowledge. More advanced degrees
also enhance job performance for personnel reaching the highest grade levels where duties may
require broader managerial skills. Enlisted-to-Air Force Institute of Technology Program. The Enlisted-to-Air Force Institute of
Technology (AFIT) program (https://www.afit.edu/) is a unique element of enlisted force
