## Section 15A — Accountability and Self-Management B B C C C

### Accountability
Accountability is defined as demonstrating reliability and honesty and taking responsibility for
the behaviors of self and team. Accountability is at the core of what it means to be an Airman. In
surveys of USAF members, accountability has been consistently rated as the most important
foundational competency for success in a USAF career. Accountability requires leading by example, admitting mistakes, and doing the right thing even
when it is unpopular or difficult. Accountable Airmen embody the USAF Core Values of Integrity
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do—and take personal responsibility even
when faced with the most challenging situations. You may not always recognize the important role your actions (or inaction) can play in a situation. Taking personal responsibility requires: Understanding the significance and potential irreversibility of failing to act
Recognizing your competence and ability to take the steps that are needed in a given
situation (self-efficacy)
Acting out of a sense of personal control (autonomy)
For example, imagine you are working in a nuclear facility. You find out that one of your friends, a nuclear weapons specialist, has been cheating on his exams to maintain weapons system
certification. Do you report him? What if your supervisor tells you to ignore the issue? Imagine you are working as a military training instructor. You observe one of your peers pushing
his trainees too hard, yelling obscenities at them when they make mistakes, and forcing them to
train more hours than is authorized. Will you say something? What if your immediate leadership
is pressuring your peer to work his trainees more hours in order to meet training goals? Significance. In each of these situations, try to understand the significance of the situation by
thinking about the bigger picture. What if the same way you responded to your co-worker in these situations was the way other
people in the USAF were responding in similar situations? That is, what would happen if not just one, but many, MTIs pushed their trainees too hard, to the
point of physical injury? What would happen if not just one, but many, nuclear weapons specialists
didn’t have sufficient expertise to repair key equipment or correctly follow emergency procedures? What does the way you would respond to these situations say about who you are as a person? Are you someone who cheats and enables cheaters? Are you someone who looks the other way
when there are potential risks to security? Are you someone who fails to stand up for the most
junior and vulnerable Airmen among us? Self-Efficacy. Self-efficacy is a person’s belief in their ability to address a situation, based on the
skills they have and the circumstances they face. Recognize your own personal strengths and think
<!-- Page 280 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
280
about how you can bring your skills to bear on a situation. For example, you can use your communication skills (reflection, active listening, and recognition
of non-verbal cues) and influence your peers by appealing to reason or shared values. You can
demonstrate perseverance and persist in addressing an issue with others. You can take initiative
and try to help peers see situations as opportunities to learn. Try to make use of your unique
strengths and talents—maybe you can teach your friend (the nuclear weapons specialist) better
study techniques to help him learn the material needed to pass his weapons system exams; maybe
you can show your friend (the MTI) better teaching techniques or coach him on how to exercise
self-control and patience when correcting trainees. Have confidence in yourself and your abilities
to address challenging situations. Autonomy. Ultimately you are your own person. You make your own decisions on your actions
or inactions. You have the freedom to choose how to respond to a situation. Even if so-called
“leaders” or “friends” try to pressure you otherwise, you can act to support the greater good. 15.2. Perseverance
As Airmen, we understand that “Excellence in All We Do” entails striving for continual selfimprovement. But too often the way we think about our abilities may hold us back. Psychologists distinguish two mindsets regarding ability and other personal qualities. Fixed
mindset refers to the belief that a person’s intelligence and other personal qualities are mostly
permanent; that you are a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can be done to really
change that. In contrast, growth mindset refers to the belief in the capacity to fundamentally
improve and significantly change the kind of person you are. Growth mindset entails a recognition
that past mistakes or failures don’t define who you are or who you can become. People with a fixed mindset are likely to give up easily when things get hard. They are constantly
trying to prove themselves (prove their intelligence, prove their natural talent) and if they don’t
excel at first, may believe there is not much that can be done to change that. They tend to be overly
sensitive about being wrong or making mistakes because they think their (initial) failures reflect a
lack of ability that can’t be changed. They may view exerting effort as evidence of inability. People with a growth mindset are likely to persist when learning new things and persevere on
even the most difficult tasks. They put in effort and focus on improving, recognizing that
challenges are needed in order to develop and grow. They don’t get defensive about mistakes, failure, or negative feedback, and don’t feel threatened by the success of others, because they don’t
view an initial lack of ability as permanent. If you are someone who holds a fixed mindset, you can begin to change your perspective and
become more perseverant: 1. Remind yourself of the differences between the fixed and growth mindsets every day. Remember that when people with a growth mindset set goals they: Persist in the face of setbacks
Embrace challenges (actively seek out difficult tasks as an opportunity to learn)
Value effort as the path to mastery
Seek feedback and learn from criticism
Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others
## Ask yourself, “What are the opportunities for learning and growth today?” then form a plan and
<!-- Page 281 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
281
begin to act on it. 3. As you encounter inevitable obstacles and setbacks, form a new plan to continue learning. 4. When you succeed, don’t forget to ask yourself: “What do I have to do to maintain and continue
the growth?”
### Self-Control
Airmen should recognize the need to exhibit self-control as part of the USAF Core Values of
Integrity First and Service Before Self. Self-control refers to a person’s ability to override or restrain their inner responses or impulses. This includes keeping emotions under control in difficult situations, handling temptations and
avoiding inappropriate behavior (e.g., controlling one’s urges to overeat or smoke, or restraining
a tendency to yell or curse when angry). Understanding both the limitations of one’s self-control
and one’s ability to strengthen it may be important to consistently demonstrate self-control when
needed. Self-Control is Limited. Like a muscle, our self-control is limited and gets depleted with heavy
use. Controlling strong urges is a heavy lift, and we can expend only so much effort before our
efforts begin to fail. As a result, changing the situation to reduce temptation is more likely to prevent inappropriate
behavior than expending effort to try to internally control urges. For example, if you love potato
chips and have a tendency to overeat, it will be more effective to keep chips out of the house
altogether (“out of sight is out of mind”) than to try to “will” yourself to eat just one. Some selfcontrol may be needed to pass up the chip aisle at the grocery store, but far stronger self-control
would be needed to avoid eating an open bag of chips that has been sitting in front of you for hours
at home. The same principle applies to avoiding inappropriate behavior when angry or upset. Removing
yourself from situations that are likely to cause you to become angry (avoiding potential “triggers”)
will be more likely to prevent outbursts than simply exerting effort internally to try to control anger
in difficult situations. Self-Control Can Become Stronger. Like a muscle, self-control can be made stronger with
practice. Regularly practicing small acts of self-control, interspersed with rest, can strengthen selfcontrol over time. Further, improving self-control in one domain (e.g., controlling urges to overeat)
has been shown to improve self-control in other domains as well (e.g., controlling other impulses, such as the tendency to curse or yell when angry). Studies have found that even two weeks of deliberate, daily practice to inhibit an urge or behavior
can meaningfully improve impulse control: Set a target goal requiring self-control (e.g., avoiding sweets and desserts, holding a handgrip
for as long as possible, despite physical discomfort)
Keep a daily record of how much effort and self-control you exert (e.g., declined cookie when
offered one that smelled delicious; held the handgrip for X minutes), and reflect on how
practicing could improve self-control. While some people naturally tend to have more self-control than others, with practice, even people
with initially poor self-control can get better at exercising restraint and avoiding temptations. <!-- Page 282 -->

### Resilience
How is it that some people seem to “bounce back” from negative experiences so quickly, while
others tend to get caught in a rut, seemingly unable to recover and move on? While external factors
such as support, relationships, and spirituality all impact resilience, our resilience can also be
affected by how we think about stressful situations. Positive reappraisal refers to the process of re-construing (re-interpreting) stressful events as nonthreatening, meaningful, and even contributing to personal growth. This cognitive strategy can
help us prepare for stressful events (by embracing challenge), and better cope with past events (by
viewing them as opportunities for learning/growth). Embracing Challenge. Imagine the following situation: You receive last-minute notice that you will need to give a presentation to an audience of highranking members. The stakes are high, and your ability (or inability) to convince the audience will
have major consequences on your career. For most people, this can be a stressful situation. But studies have shown that our ability to manage
potentially stressful events like this can be affected by how we frame the situation. Specifically, when we view a situation in terms of threat (e.g., focusing on task difficulty and how other people
will evaluate us), our heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure increase, and it takes us longer to calm
down afterwards. When we instead frame the same situation in terms of challenge, we tend to recover faster (heart
rate, pulse, and blood pressure return to normal more quickly after the event). For example, before
going into a stressful situation, you might tell yourself (or one of your Airmen): “Even though this is a difficult task, it is a challenge that can be met and overcome. I have
overcome other challenges in the past, and if I try hard to do my best, I can meet this challenge as
well.”
When framed this way in terms of challenge, people report experiencing less anxiety about the
task, and demonstrate faster recovery. Viewing Negative Events as Opportunities for Growth. Sometimes negative events happen to everyone—your presentation went poorly and you received
a poor performance evaluation. Or you experienced adversity outside of work-- you got divorced, were in an accident, experienced the death of a family member, etc. Experts recommend reflecting on the problems and challenges we have faced. Try to make sense
of the circumstances and ask yourself: Is there something you could learn from this situation? Can you envision something good coming out of dealing with this problem? How could the event change your life in a positive way? How could you find benefit in this situation in the long-term? Some examples of cognitive reappraisal to learn or grow from otherwise negative events: Someone who has a heart attack might view the event as a “wake up call” and chance to modify
their lifestyle and begin to change their diet. Someone whose spouse becomes seriously ill might view the need for caregiving as
<!-- Page 283 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
283
deepening their relationship and level of intimacy. Someone who has been abused might view their survival as evidence of their strength, and they
might decide to dedicate their life to helping others make similar recoveries. Importantly, there is often the opportunity to learn from even more mundane stressful events. For
example, having been treated rudely by a supervisor, one might learn how to relate more
effectively with one’s own subordinates in the future (i.e., having understanding of what type of
supervisory behavior to avoid). Rather than a wishful denial of reality, cognitive reappraisal allows us to actively find meaning in
adversity so that we can flexibly grow and adapt longer term. <!-- Page 284 -->

### Communication as a Foundational Competency
Communication (oral, written, and nonverbal) is critical throughout a USAF career. Recognized
as a foundational competency, the USAF has defined effective communication to include skills
such as: Presenting complex information articulately and concisely
Tailoring communication to address concerns of the audience
Voicing differing opinions on contentious issues without triggering a defensive response
Attending to non-verbal cues, and communicating with sensitivity to others’ needs
This chapter addresses communication in its many forms within the USAF, from high-level
strategic communication to routine meetings and email writing. While some communication
formats described in this chapter are specific to the military, many of the communication principles
described later in this chapter will serve members well even when transitioning to civilian careers. 15.6. Strategic Communication
Airmen must ensure audiences know and understand what the USAF needs, where we are going, and how we can be positioned for success. Because communication can be broken into three parts: the sender, the message, and the audience, we must be aware of and responsible for how we
communicate, including the way our communication is perceived by others. Strategic
communication is viewed as an emerging and extremely important concept, resulting in strategic
communication being designated as a special area of emphasis. Strategic Communication: Defined. The Department of Defense broadly defines strategic
communication as a process of purposefully using communication for the intent of advancing
national interests and objectives through synchronized integration of information with other
elements of national power. Communication synchronization entails focused efforts to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of national interests, policies, and objectives by understanding and engaging key audiences through the use of coordinated
actions. In other words, strategic communication is implemented by aligning actions, words, and
images with the purpose of obtaining a specific objective or objectives. Leaders use strategic
messaging to advocate the unique functions and distinct capabilities of airpower to project national
influence and respond to national defense requirements. 15.7. Enterprise Perspective
Having an enterprise perspective in strategic communication empowers USAF leaders to inform
and appropriately influence key audiences by synchronizing and integrating communication
efforts to deliver truthful, timely, accurate, and credible information, analysis, and opinion. Truth
is the foundation of all public communications, both in terms of credibility and capability. Timely
and agile dissemination of information is essential to achieving desired effects. Without
appropriate information dissemination, strategic communication cannot maximize value or
potential. It must be conducted at the time, level, and manner for which it is intended. Our USAF Story. Effectively communicating who we are as Airmen underwrites our ability to
be successful in all areas of engagement. USAF leaders want every Airman to be a communicator
<!-- Page 285 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
285
or spokesperson for the USAF, and through the enterprise perspective, be able to tell their USAF
story. All Airmen need to know how to integrate their personal USAF story and experience into a
message that adds credibility to USAF, DoD, and national strategic communication. 15.8. Public Affairs
An important aspect of communication is speaking in public forums and recognizing the need for
strategic communication alignment; this involves communication synchronization. As stated in
AFI 1-1, the purpose of Public Affairs (PA) operations is to communicate timely, accurate, and
useful information about USAF activities to Department of Defense, the USAF, as well as
domestic and international audiences. The PA representative is the commander’s principal
spokesperson and advisor, and a member of the personal staff. PA advises the commander on the
implications of command decisions, actions, and operations on foreign and domestic public
perceptions. PA plans, executes, and evaluates activities and events to support overall operational
success. The PA representative must have the resources to provide information, including visual
information, to the staff, public, media, and subordinate units in near real time. PA should be
involved in planning, decision-making, training, equipping, and executing operations as well as
integrating PA activities into all levels of command. Additional information regarding public
affairs can be found in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Operations, 20 November 2020. Note: Although
briefly covered in standards of conduct and enforcing standards, propriety, and perception, it is
important to mention that any activity not in alignment with good order, discipline, and national
security may intentionally or unintentionally generate a negative perception of the USAF. Commanders have the authority and responsibility to address situations that could be perceived
negatively, while also being mindful of preserving the service member’s right of expression within
these interests. More specific information on permitted and prohibited activities can be found in
DAFI 51-508, Political Activities, Free Speech and Freedom of Assembly. 15.9. Social Media
Airmen interact with individuals via face-to-face, telephone, written letter, e-mail, text messages, social networking services, and social media. Social networking includes weblogs, message
boards, video sharing, and services, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and
Snapchat, used by individuals and communities to stay in touch. Appropriate Posts. Individuals are responsible for what they say, share, or post on social
networking services. Offensive and inappropriate communication must be avoided. Also, Airmen
who provide commentary and opinions on internet blogs may not place comments on those blog
sites which reasonably can be anticipated or are intended to degrade morale, good order, and
discipline of any members or units in the U.S. Armed Forces; are service-discrediting; or would
degrade the trust and confidence of the public. Additionally, it is important to recognize that social
network “friends” and “followers” may potentially constitute relationships that could affect
background investigations and periodic reinvestigations associated with security clearances. Additional information regarding social media can be found in: DAFH 33-337 The Tongue and
Quill, and DAFI 35-101, Public Affairs. Operations Security. Operations security is vital to the accomplishment of the USAF mission. The use of social media and other forums that allow communication with large numbers of people
brings with it the increased risk of magnifying operational security lapses. Classified, controlled
unclassified information, and other official Department of Defense information and documents are
prohibited from being posted on social networking services or transmitted via non-Department of
Defense e-mail accounts without proper authority. <!-- Page 286 -->

### Military References for Communicating
JP 1-02, DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, supplements English-language
dictionaries and standardizes terminology used within the Department of Defense, other federal
agencies, and among the United States and its allies. It is a compilation of definitions, abbreviations, and acronyms applicable to the Department of Defense and its components, often
used as a primary source for official correspondence and planning documents. The Air University Style and Author Guide (AU-1) provides guidance on writing, editing, and
publishing matters related to official publications for the Air University. Also, AU-1 is a valuable
reference for grammar, mechanics, and documentation of sources for those with an interest in
military acronyms, ranks, and specialized military terms. The U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual is the approved reference for all forms and
styles of government printing. Essentially, the style manual is a standardization reference
designed to achieve uniformity in word and type, aimed toward economy of word use. The Tongue and Quill is not an all-inclusive reference, but provides valuable, detailed information
on most presentations and papers produced in professional military education courses. References, such as the Modern Language Association (MLA) Style Guide, the Chicago Manual
of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA) Style Guide, are widely recognized in
the civilian sector and organizations following college and university writing standards. They
provide useful information when conducting research or developing written products. 15.11. Military Phonetic Alphabet
All branches of the U.S. Government and military departments use the International Civil Aviation
Organization alphabet for radio communication. This phonetic alphabet was adopted by the U.S. Armed Forces in 1956 and is currently used by North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and
civil aviation around the world. Table 15.1. shows the letters, code words, and pronunciation. <!-- Page 287 -->

### Organizational Communication
Organizational communication refers to the strategic sharing of information, both internally and
externally, within and across the organizational industry. Leaders must exhibit solid organizational
communication skills to accomplish organization- and mission-related goals. Creating a culture of
communication and maintaining relevance empowers people to own the organizational
communication message at every level. According to Caldwell, Stroud, and Menning, in Fostering
a Culture of Engagement, to be effective, an organizational culture must be proactive, innovative, adaptive, leader driven, and sustainable. Proactive. To be proactive means to seize the initiative and be agile in communicating the
message. The capacity to be proactive enables leaders to get out front and communicate their
perspectives and experiences on important topics. Innovative. To be innovative means to exercise ingenuity in seeking new effective ways of
communicating. Relying on more than raw creative thinking, innovation requires an understanding
of the characteristics and capabilities of information sharing and the pace of change. Adaptive. Adaptive, modern communication capabilities thrive in a fast-evolving, instantaneous, and interconnected information environment that presents challenges to rigid and inflexible
organizations. The key to success in this environment is adjusting to changing circumstances on
the run. Leader Driven. USAF leaders must confront modern media realities by fostering a culture of
engagement in their subordinates and commands. Leaders set the command climate by making
themselves available for communication, especially during times of crisis. Sustainable. Leadership is essential to instilling focus and function for the culture of engagement. Sustainability requires dedicated resources and manpower to build enduring capabilities to enable
a culture of engagement. <!-- Page 288 -->

### Communicating Intent
Like many things, good communication requires preparation. Preparation is the most important
aspect, and sometimes the time best spent, with regard to good communication. By being prepared, speakers show audiences that they value their time as well as the topic of interest. Being prepared
enhances a speaker’s confidence as well as their credibility when communicating a message. Confidence will be a great factor in successful delivery of the message, along with additional
aspects covered here for establishing strong spoken communication skills. Success as a military leader requires the ability to think critically and creatively. It is also crucial
to be able to communicate intentions and decisions to others. The ability to communicate clearly—
to write, speak, and actively listen—greatly impacts the capacity to inform, teach, motivate, mentor, and lead others. Communicating intent and ideas so others understand the message and
act on it is one of the primary qualities of leadership. 15.14. Principles of Effective Communication
Communication requires a combination of the appropriate quality and quantity of information
sharing. While communication can be broken into three parts: the sender, the message, and the
audience, for communication to be successful the audience must not only receive the message, but
they must interpret the message the way the sender intended. This section addresses five core
principles of communication: focused, organized, clear, understanding, and supported (FOCUS). Focused. Being focused means understanding what the issue is, considering all aspects of the
issue, and not straying from the issue. Address the issue, the whole issue, and nothing but the issue. Organized. Good organization means presenting information in a logical, systematic manner. When information is not well organized, audiences may become confused, impatient, or
inattentive. Even if you are providing useful, relevant information, the importance of your message
may be lost to the audience if it is disorganized. Clear. Communicate with clarity and make each word count. Clear communication occurs when
the sender is able to properly articulate and formulate the message to the audience. To
communicate clearly, be sure to understand the proper pronunciation of words and how to
assemble and punctuate sentences. Also, clear communication often requires getting to the point. Understanding. Understand your audience and its expectations. Understanding the audience’s
current knowledge, views, and level of interest regarding a topic helps when sharing ideas with
others. Understanding expectations of format and length of response, due date, level of formality, and any staffing requirements helps when responding to a request for information. Supported. Be sure to support your communication with information that substantiates your
position but does not bring the audience to question your message. Nothing cripples a clearly
written, properly punctuated paper quicker than implied data or a distorted argument. Support and
logic should be used to build credibility and trust with your audience. 15.15. Seven Steps for Effective Communication
As indicated in DAFH 33-337, the seven steps for effective communication are fundamental to
good speaking and writing skills. The first four steps lay the groundwork for the drafting process
<!-- Page 289 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
289
of effective communication, steps five through seven are where the communication takes the form
of a well-prepared message. The seven steps for effective communication and a brief explanation
of what they entail are provided here. 1. Analyze Purpose and Audience. Be clear on your purpose and know and understand your
audience when preparing to communicate your message. This is often accomplished by
determining what your message is and why you are communicating it to your audience. In this step
you will want to ask yourself, is your purpose for communicating to direct, inform, persuade, or
inspire. Once you know your intent, you can design your message around your purpose statement
or the intent you have in mind. 2. Research Your Topic. Be resourceful and informed when preparing to communicate your
message. There may be experts in your workplace who you can talk to for insights and advice on
researching your topic. Also, information is at our fingertips, so consider what you know and what
you don’t know and gather data that is pertinent and relevant to your topic. DAFH 33-337, Chapter
4, provides a comprehensive list of online sources, websites, and databases that will prove to be
very helpful in gathering information for your topic. You may find it valuable to save many of the
links as favorites in your web browser for quick access. 3. Support Your Ideas. Be sure to strengthen your communication by providing information that
will support your message. There are a number of ways you can develop a strong message in your
communication. It is essential to choose the methods that best enhance your credibility and portray
your argument as valid and reliable. Depending on your message and your audience, you may
choose to reinforce your position on an issue through evidence using definitions, examples, testimony, or statistics. Focus your approach using trustworthy, accurate, precise, relevant, and
sufficient evidence that will support your ideas and gain the trust of your audience. 4. Organize and Outline. Be organized and purposeful in your approach to communicating your
message. There are several ways to organize information; you will want to choose the one that
allows your message to reach the audience in the best manner possible. There are several patterns
available in DAFH 33-337, Chapter 6. The pattern you choose will depend greatly on whether
your intent is to direct, inform, persuade, or inspire. You may find that your topic is best presented
chronologically, using an approach that covers pertinent information in a time-ordered sequence. Or you may decide that a sequential approach is most appropriate that presents your information
in a step-by-step manner. 5. Draft. Be willing to get your thoughts into a draft product. Your draft is just the beginning of
formulating your communication into an organized, outlined, purposeful manner. It will not be
perfect. As long as you follow the basic structure of having an introduction, body, and conclusion, you will have a template to work with while you sharpen your message, develop your thoughts, and clarify your approach. Keep in mind the structure of your communication and consider
including key aspects, such as reaching your audience, following format, and ensuring your
message flows with transitions between main points or main ideas. Your efforts will never be a
waste of time as long as you remember that your draft is the essential step toward creating your
final product. DAFH 33-337, Chapter 7, provides several suggestions and examples of how to
develop a draft of your message using recommended structure, verbiage, and phrases. 6. Edit. Following the first five steps of the effective communication process will set you up for
success, but it will not guarantee a perfect product, and you should not expect your draft to be. That is what steps six and seven are for. Have your draft written early enough to give yourself time
to take a break before looking it over through an editing lens. This will allow you to edit with fresh
eyes. Think about what you would like to accomplish with your work and keep that in mind as you
<!-- Page 290 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
290
look over your draft. Consider how it may look or sound to the audience as you edit your work. Whether your communication is written or spoken, you may find value in reading your work out
loud to catch areas for improvement that wouldn’t have been readily identifiable otherwise. As
you review, look for three main aspects of your draft product: 1) review for the big picture, main
purpose, length, and flow of ideas; 2) review for paragraph structure, clarity, organization of
material, and supporting ideas; then 3) review sentences, phrases, words, grammar, and consider
how the audience will perceive or receive the message. 7. Fight for Feedback and Get Approval. Be receptive to feedback from others. Now that you’ve
done your best at formulating your message, it’s time to seek feedback. Even the best
communicators can overlook key aspects of their messages. In this step, allow your pride in
authorship to be set aside and seek pride in other’s willingness to review and provide feedback on
your work. Communicate up front with your reviewers what your strengths and weaknesses are
and let them know why you selected them to provide feedback to you. To best utilize time, express
what areas you most likely need feedback on. This will help reviewers know where to focus their
efforts and it will enable them to be most helpful to you when providing feedback. 15.16. Job Interview Preparation
Before committing yourself to the effort required of applying and interviewing for a job, you need
to understand the experience or skills required for the job and whether or not you possess those
experiences or skills. One of the first steps in preparing for a job interview is carefully studying
the job advertisement or position description so you understand the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities required. Once you have successfully aligned your knowledge, skills, and abilities to
the job, then gather all required information and documentation for the application process. Applying for the Job. When applying for special duty, seeking employment, or simply gathering
pertinent information to successfully build a resume or application package in the future, there are
different employer expectations you will want to be familiar with. In many cases, you may need
to submit an application package with various documents, such as recent performance reports, personnel documents, a resume, a job application, a curriculum vitae, a biography, letters of
recommendation, a cover letter, and in some cases, college transcripts. Any of these documents
submitted for a job application should be tailored to highlight your particular knowledge, skills, and abilities related to the position for which you are applying. Interviewing for the Job. Many USAF positions require a job interview. Knowing how to prepare
for and conduct yourself during an interview can go a long way toward helping you get selected
for a special duty or other career broadening position in the USAF, not to mention being hired in
the civilian sector. Prior to the interview, put yourself in the mindset that everything the interviewer
sees or hears from you is part of the interview. The interview begins the moment you pick up the
phone or enter the property of the organization. Think about how you will be perceived, how you
will enter the conversation, how you will ask and answer questions, and anything else you think
will occur before, during, or after the interview. If you are having a phone interview, ensure you
will be in an environment where you can solely focus on the interview. It is a good idea to research the mission and history of the hiring organization before the interview. The more you know about the organization, the better you will be at convincing potential
employers that you care about the organization, as well as the job you’re seeking. Information you
can often find about the organization in advance might include who the commander and senior
enlisted members of the organization are, how large the organization is, and what the mission and
vision statements are. Interviewers expect candidates to ask intelligent, thoughtful questions
concerning the organization and the nature of the work. The nature and quality of your questions
<!-- Page 291 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
291
will reveal your interest in the organization and the position you’re seeking. When the interviewer
asks if you have any questions or concerns about the job or the organization, be prepared with at
least one or two things you’d like to talk about. If you submitted an application package prior to the interview, there is a strong possibility that you
will be asked questions about the information you provided. Review all of the documents you
submitted, keep the documents nearby during the interview, and be prepared to highlight examples
of your skills or experiences relating to the strengths you can contribute to the job. Examples of
areas to concentrate on are problem-solving skills, thoughts on organizational transformation, team-building skills, support for the organization’s priorities, your leadership philosophy, your
ability to adapt and work in fast-paced environments, and decision-making abilities. Also, be able
to answer the following questions: Why should I hire you? How soon can you report? How will this change affect your family? What do you see as one of your biggest challenges with a job like this? Where do you see
yourself in two to three years? Are there any issues to prevent you from accepting or performing in this position? Purpose of Interviews. All job interviews are designed with one goal in mind - to find the right
person for the right job. Employers may have to interview several individuals for a position, so
keep your goal in mind and let the interviewer see what skills and experiences you can bring to the
job. Also, not only are you interviewing for a job; you are interviewing the prospective employer
to see if the job is right for you. Be sure you understand the conditions of the job and ask for
clarification during the interview, if needed. It is important to determine whether you truly are
interested in committing the next few years to the potential job or assignment. As the interview
draws to a close, before the interview is over, take a brief opportunity to provide one or two main
points that you want the interviewer to remember about you. In other words, have your walk-away
points in mind so you end the interview on a positive note and reemphasize your interest in the
position. Post-interview Actions. In some cases, it may be appropriate to follow up after an interview. A
day or two after the interview you may choose to send a short thank-you note to the organization
with which you interviewed to express your gratitude for the opportunity to interview for the job, restate your interest in the position, highlight any particularly noteworthy points, or address
anything you wish to further clarify. 15.17. Meetings
Deciding how to communicate a message is important. If you have a message that can be sent
clearly and accurately via e-mail, that is one of the quickest forms of sending a message. If you
need to send a message that requires an immediate response or might need clarification or
elaboration that could be lost in translation through e-mail, discussing the issue over the phone
may be the best approach to take. If your message needs to involve multiple people or requires
dialogue (sometimes on a recurring basis), you may need to have a face-to-face conversation. Meetings can be used to share information, solve problems, plan, brainstorm, or motivate. Whatever their purpose, you need to know some basics about conducting an effective meeting. A
way to determine whether a meeting is the most appropriate method of communicating a message
is to consider if you want to address a group about information, advice, concerns, problem solving, or decision-making. Meetings allow for cross-talk to discuss these types of issues, whether within
<!-- Page 292 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
292
an organization or with outside agencies. Once you have decided that a meeting is the most appropriate method of communicating the
message or issue, the next steps are to define the purpose of the meeting, decide who should be
invited to participate or be a part of the conversation, decide where and when the meeting should
occur, plan for capturing (recording) meeting information, send out an agenda so attendees can be
prepared to discuss pertinent topics, and be flexible based on availability of attendees, information, or other considerations. Running the meeting requires that a few simple rules be followed, but not
to the extent that the meetings are rigid, predictable, and non-productive. As long as you start and
stay on time, follow the agenda, understand group dynamics, and follow up with well formatted
meeting minutes, your meeting will have a good foundation for success. <!-- Page 293 -->

### Writing Platforms
The USAF has adopted common, basic formats of written communication for official and personal
correspondence and memorandums. Understanding the purpose of these formats will best serve
your superiors, yourself, and your subordinates in using the proper format for the intended purpose. DAFH 33-337 outlines detailed instructions for written communication, while various
organizations may have adopted internally preferred styles as well. One key aspect for choosing
the appropriate format to use for written communication is consistency in your approach. Attention to detail, proper format, and pertinent information will ensure written communication
serves as a professional representation of your organization. 15.19. Official Memorandum
Official memorandums are used to communicate throughout the Department of Defense and other
federal agencies. In addition, official memorandums are used to conduct official business outside
the government with vendors or contractors when the personal letter is not appropriate. Memorandums may be addressed to specific officials, single offices, multiple offices, multiple
offices IN TURN, or to DISTRIBUTION lists. Detailed information pertaining to the heading, text, and closing sections of the official memorandum, as well as additional information, attachments, and examples, are provided in DAFH 33-337, Chapter 14. 15.20. Personal Letter
Use the personal letter when communication needs a personal touch or when warmth or sincerity
is preferred. The personal letter may be used to write to an individual on a private matter, such as
for praise, condolence, or sponsorship. Keep the personal letter brief, preferably no longer than
one page, and avoid using acronyms. Specific information pertaining to the heading, text, and
closing sections of the personal letter, as well as forms of address, ranks, abbreviations, additional
information, and examples, are provided in DAFH 33-337, Chapter 15. 15.21. Air Force Papers
The USAF uses written products (papers) in many forms for everyday staff work to serve a variety
of functions. The types of USAF papers include the point paper, talking paper, bullet background
paper, background paper, position paper, and the staff study. Be sure that the type of format used
is appropriate for the task. Samples, explanations, and examples of USAF papers are provided in
DAFH 33-337, Chapters 16. Point Paper. The point paper is used when addressing a single issue that can be covered within a
single page using bullets or phrases that require minimal data. The function of a point paper is to
provide a memory jogger, a minimal text outline of a single issue, and to quickly inform others, often extemporaneously (with little or no-notice). It can be used to give the same short message
many times, or to cue a speaker to a recite something from memory. Talking Paper. The talking paper is slightly more detailed than the point paper. It is used when
addressing a single issue that can be covered within a single page using bullets or phrases that
provide key reference data. The function of a talking paper is to provide notes for a presenter or
speaker used as an outline or narrative for a single issue to inform others during planned/scheduled
oral presentations. It is used as a quick reference on key points, facts, or positions, such as
<!-- Page 294 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
294
frequently asked questions, and can stand alone for basic understanding of an issue. Bullet Background Paper. The bullet background paper is used when addressing a single issue
or several related issues that can be covered within a single page or multi-page format using bullet
statements providing the background of a program, policy, problem, or procedure. Bullet
background papers are developed using concise chronology of a program, policy, or problem, and
can be used to explain or provide details regarding an attached talking paper. Background Paper. The background paper is used when addressing a single issue or several
related issues using a multi-page format including full sentences, details, and numbered
paragraphs. It is often used as a multi-purpose staff communication instrument to express ideas or
describe conditions that require a particular staff action. Background papers are developed using
the detailed chronology of a program, policy, or problem, and can condense and summarize
complex issues by providing background research for oral presentations or staff discussions. The
background paper provides a means of informing decision-makers with important details. Position Paper. The position paper is used when addressing a single issue or several related issues
using a multi-page format including full sentences, details, and numbered paragraphs. It is often
used when working with proposals for a new program, policy, procedure, or plan. Position papers
are used to circulate a proposal to generate interest, evaluate a proposal, or advocate a position on
a proposal to decision-makers. 15.22. Staff Study
The staff study is used when addressing a single issue or several related issues using a multi-page
research paper including a detailed discussion with a conclusion and applicable recommendations. The purpose of the staff study is to analyze a problem, draw conclusions, and make
recommendations. Format will vary for staff studies depending on the need or complexity of
information required. Staff studies are used to assist decision-makers and leaders in initiating
research, to inform and recommend change, and as a problem-solving thought process in written
form. Note: Not all organizations routinely use the staff study, but it is an accepted format for a
problem-solution report for both the USAF and Joint Staff. The value of using a staff study as a
thought process often outweighs the particular format used to communicate findings. Understanding and applying the essential elements of problem analysis via a staff study will enable
better application of any staff communication. 15.23. The Staff Package
The staff package is a writing format commonly used in the USAF for routing or coordinating
correspondence through a staffing process. A widely recognized aspect of the staff package is the
AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. The staff summary sheet, known as the “SSS,” the “TripleS,” or the “e-SSS,” is the cover page (the first page) of a staff package. It provides a condensed
summary of the purpose, background, discussion, view of others (when applicable), recommendation, signature blocks, and overall contents of the staff package. <!-- Page 295 -->

### Speaking Platforms

Verbal communication includes everyday interactions with coworkers, communicating up and
down the chain of command, and sometimes speaking to audiences. Being aware of various verbal
communication platforms can help ensure the message being communicated is delivered and
received as intended. 15.25. Delivery Formats
Your approach to delivery of the spoken message is usually affected by several factors, including
the time you have to prepare and the nature of the message. Three common delivery formats are
impromptu, prepared, and manuscript. Impromptu. Impromptu speaking is when we respond during a meeting or “take the floor” at a
conference. Speakers may do this when they have to speak publicly without warning or with only
a few moments’ notice. To do impromptu speaking well requires a great amount of selfconfidence, mastery of the subject, and the ability to “think on your feet.” A superb impromptu
speaker has achieved the highest level in verbal communications. Prepared. Prepared speaking or briefing refers to those times when we have ample opportunity to
prepare. This does not mean the person writes a script and memorizes it, but prepared delivery
does require a thorough outline with careful planning and practicing. The specific words and
phrases used at the time of delivery; however, are spontaneous and sound very natural. Manuscript. A manuscript briefing is the delivery format that requires every word spoken to be
absolutely perfect. The disadvantage of a manuscript briefing is that people demonstrate a
tendency to lack spontaneity, lack eye contact, and they stand behind the lectern with their script. These mannerisms may have a tendency of losing the audience’s attention. 15.26. Types of Speaking
Typically, the types of speaking used in the USAF include the briefing, the teaching lecture, and
the formal speech. Briefing. The major purpose of a briefing is to inform listeners about a mission, operation, or
concept. Some briefings direct or enable listeners to perform a procedure or carry out instructions. Other briefings advocate, persuade, or support a certain solution and lead the audience to accept
the briefing. Every good briefing has the qualities of accuracy, brevity, and clarity. Accuracy and
clarity characterize all good speaking, but brevity distinguishes the briefing from other types of
speaking. A briefer must be brief and to the point and should anticipate some of the questions that
may arise. If a briefer cannot answer a question, he or she should not attempt an off-the-cuff
answer. Instead, he or she should request an opportunity to research the question and follow-up
with an answer at a later time. Teaching Lecture. The teaching lecture is the method of instruction most often used in the USAF. As the name implies, the primary purpose of a teaching lecture is to teach an audience about a
given subject. Teaching lectures are either formal or informal. Formal lectures are generally oneway with no verbal participation by the audience. Informal lectures are usually presented to smaller
audiences and allow for verbal interaction. <!-- Page 296 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
296
Formal Speech. A formal speech generally has one of three basic purposes: to inform, persuade, or entertain. The informative speech is a narration concerning a specific topic, but it does not
involve a sustained effort to teach. Orientation talks and presentations at commander’s call are
examples of informative speeches. The persuasive speech is designed to move an audience to
believe in or take action on a topic, such as recruiting speeches to high school graduating classes. Entertaining speeches often include humor and wit to entertain listeners, such as a speech to
entertain at a dining-out. 15.27. Basic Communication Tips
Beginning any communication with basic communication tips in mind and being mindful of others
when speaking and listening will enhance communication skills in any environment. Some basic
military communication tips that can be used in any setting are provided here. Rank. Differences in military rank can be a barrier (real or perceived) to communication in the
USAF. Many of us instinctively communicate differently with those senior in rank than we do
with those with those who are junior in rank. We must constantly strive to be candid, direct, and
respectful with everyone we communicate with. Jargon. Do not overestimate the knowledge and expertise of others when it comes to jargon. Be
careful with excessive use of career-field specific jargon and acronyms, but feel free to use jargon
when appropriate. As the speaker, it is your responsibility to ensure your communication is
understandable. DELETED. Tone. Tone is not just what you say, but how you say it. Use of tone can be valuable when
enhancing a message, but it can be difficult to portray in written communication. Speakers use
gestures, voice, and movements to communicate; writers do not. Emojis ☺ do not have a place in
written formal communication. Recognize the limitations of expressing tone through written
communication and pay close attention to how the message may be perceived. Courtesy. The first rule of communicating courteously is being polite. Forego anger, criticism, and sarcasm, and strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Be patient and tactful, regardless of the
challenges of delivering a message. If you have to, push back from the computer, take a deep
breath, slowly count to 10, then review your message to ensure it is professional and courteous. Make it Personal. When appropriate, use pronouns, such as we, us, and our, to create rapport and
keep your audience involved. Using pronouns also keeps your message from being monotonous, dry, and abstract. Use I, me, and my sparingly, and be aware of how the use of you can be perceived
in some situations. Formal. “Good morning, Sir.” versus informal “Hey” or “What’s up?” is always the more
professional approach to greeting or addressing someone. While in today’s USAF much
communication among peers will be informal, it is essential to recognize, particularly during
events and ceremonies, when formal, professional communication is appropriate. Be Positive. Cultivate a positive message and give praise where praise is due. Rather than focusing
on problem areas, optimism can encourage acceptance of a message. Also, encourage and be
receptive to criticism in the form of helpful questions, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or
information. Audiences often sense and appreciate sincerity and honesty. 15.28. Communication Delivery
An effective voice drives home ideas; however, communication experts believe over half of the
meaning of any message may be communicated nonverbally. Several suggestions for effective
<!-- Page 297 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
297
verbal and nonverbal communication are provided here. Rate. There is no correct speed for every speech. However, consider that people can listen four to
five times faster than the normal spoken rate of 120 words a minute. So, if you speak too slowly, you may lose the interest of an audience who is processing information much faster than you are
delivering it. Also, consider speaking at a faster rate to indicate excitement or sudden action, or at
a slower rate to hint at a calm or more serious message. Volume. Volume is a verbal technique that can be used to give emphasis to your speech. Consider
speaking louder or softer to emphasize a point—a softer level or lower volume is often the more
effective way to achieve emphasis. Depending on the type of room, it may be necessary to talk
louder in front of a large crowd to ensure everyone in the room can hear the message. When
possible, use a portable microphone, particularly in large auditoriums. If the audience must strain
to hear you, they will eventually tune you out from exhaustion, but the front row will not want to
feel like they are being yelled at the entire time either. Pitch. Pitch is the use of higher or lower notes in voice range. Using variety in speech pitch helps
to avoid monotone delivery and capture the listener’s attention. Starting with a voice range that is
comfortable for you and then adjusting pitch for emphasis may help make communication more
interesting. You can use a downward (high to low) inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty
and an upward (low to high) inflection for an air of uncertainty. Pause. Pause gives a speaker time to catch their breath and the audience time to absorb ideas. Short pauses usually divide points within a sentence, while long pauses note the ends of sentences. Longer pauses can be used for breaks between main points or transitions between an introduction, body, and conclusion. Another use for the pause is to ‘pause for effect’ or to set off an important
point worthy of short reflection. Sometimes a pause may seem long to the speaker, but allow time
for a true (one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three…) pause for emphasis. Articulation and Pronunciation. Articulation and pronunciation reflect mastery of the spoken
English language. Articulation is the art of expressing words distinctly. Pronunciation is the ability
to say words correctly. Unfortunately, and unfairly, people may consider word pronunciation or
mispronunciation as a reflection of your message. Listen to yourself, better yet, if possible, ask
someone to listen to you for practice, and make sure your words are distinct, understandable, and
appropriate to your audience. Length. In our military environment, you must be able to relay your thoughts and ideas succinctly. A key rule in verbal communication is to keep it short and sweet. Know what you want to say and
say it with your purpose and the audience in mind. Eye Contact. Eye contact is one of the most important factors in nonverbal communication. Eye
contact lets listeners know the speaker is interested in them, allows the speaker to receive
nonverbal feedback from the audience, and enhances the credibility of the speaker. Gestures. Gestures are the purposeful use of the hands, arms, shoulders, and head to reinforce
what is being said. Effective gestures are natural and should not be distracting to the audience. Purposeful, effective body movement can be described as free, yet deliberate movement. 15.29. Overcoming Anxiety
Public speaking is often one of the biggest self-induced fears we experience in the workplace. Some individuals appear to be immune to stage fright, while others are paralyzed with fear prior
<!-- Page 298 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
298
to stepping onto a stage, up to a podium, or speaking from any platform. Most Airmen are exposed
to public speaking opportunities in academic environments. Additional speaking opportunities can
help individuals begin to feel more comfortable in the spotlight, such as small, localized events
(awards ceremonies and commander’s calls) where the audience is familiar. To prepare for these
events, a draft script may be available to practice with. Having a wingman as a supporter and a
‘fan’ in the audience can be a big confidence booster while developing public speaking skills. Having anxiety about public speaking can hinder the ability to get a message across successfully; however, appearing too relaxed on stage may give the impression that the speaker is not fully
committed to the presentation or to the audience. To overcome anxiety, try to think of it this way, most often those in the audience are really just glad it’s not them up there on the stage. And for
you, you’re on your way to becoming a more confident, competent public speaker by accepting
the opportunity for personal and professional growth. Whether you are engaging in public speaking for the first time or if you have been on the stage
several times before, here are some simple steps to remember to ensure your message is received
clearly and as intended. Know the material, the script, or topic to be covered at the event. Analyze your audience to reduce your fear of the unknown. Envision yourself having a successful experience in front of the audience. Practice using a recording device, video camera, full-length mirror, or an audience of your
peers. Be prepared to allow yourself to mentally feel confident about the experience. Present a professional image to build self-confidence and credibility with the audience. Smile, your audience wants you to succeed. Chances are your audience won’t know how
nervous you are if you don’t mention it. Take a short walk right before you go on stage to help release nervous energy. When it comes time for the event, it’s time to deliver. Focus your attention on the purpose of
the event, not on yourself. Connect with your audience. When possible, encourage audience interaction, such as head nods or reassuring affirmations. 15.30. Common Nonverbal Quirks
While seeking opportunities to sharpen public speaking skills, practice to eliminate some of the
crutches or habits that speakers sometimes fall into. Tips on overcoming nervous habits are
included here to help public speakers become consciously aware of them and work to overcome
them before stepping into the spotlight. Life Raft. The life raft is a term used when a speaker seeks the safety and security of a podium
as though his or life depends upon it. Sometimes standing at the podium is necessary when using
a stationary microphone, a script, or notes. While this is an acceptable place for a speaker to stand, when possible, try to venture away from the podium to connect better with the audience. Awkward Hands. Awkward hands are typically more of a feeling the speaker has than it is an
observation of the audience. Simply allowing hands to hang naturally may feel awkward, but it’s
perfectly natural from the audience’s perspective. Practice allowing your hands to hang naturally, and it’ll eventually begin to feel natural. <!-- Page 299 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
299
Caged Tiger. The caged tiger is a term used when a speaker paces across a stage from one side
to the other without stopping. Using the width of a stage to connect with an audience is a good
idea, just be sure not to pace back and forth to where the audience feels like they’re watching a
tennis match. Relax and settle into a natural rhythm of using the stage purposefully. Rocker. Rockers are caged tigers on the road to recovery. Rockers have settled their nervous
energy somewhat, but still have not become completely comfortable with standing still and simply
talking. As you practice, make a conscious effort not to fall into the habit of rocking on your heels
or swaying side to side. Much like allowing your hands to hang naturally at your side, with practice
you will become more comfortable simply standing confidently and addressing an audience. Too Cool. Some speakers overcompensate for a fear of speaking by trying to look extremely
comfortable. It is a good idea to appear relaxed, but not at the expense of appearing unengaged or
disinterested in speaking to your audience. You may have conquered your nerves, but keep in mind
that you want to reach your audience and keep their attention. 15.31. Effective Listening
Gaining a better understanding of the listening process begins with understanding the difference
between hearing and listening. Hearing occurs when ears pick up sounds being transmitted by a
speaker or another source. Listening, on the other hand, involves hearing, while also paying
attention to and giving consideration to what is heard. In other words, listening involves thinking
about and making sense of the message. Effective, active listening involves engaging verbally and
nonverbally in the listening process to appropriately respond, comprehend, evaluate, and
remember a message. Effective listening helps build trust and mutual respect. Leaders with good
listening skills often make better decisions. Informative Listening. In informative listening, the listener’s primary concern is to understand
information exactly as transmitted. Successful (effective) listening occurs when the listener
understands the message exactly as the sender intended. Suggestions for improving informative
listening are to keep an open mind and set aside bias, listen as if you had to teach it, take notes to
help recall the main points, ask questions to clarify or confirm your understanding of the message, and maximize the use of the time by mentally repeating the message and absorbing the information
in a way that makes the information more pertinent and applicable to you. Critical Listening. Critical listening is usually thought of as the sum of informative listening and
critical thinking because the listener is actively analyzing and evaluating the message the speaker
is sending. Critical listening is appropriate when seeking input to a decision, evaluating work or a
subordinate’s capabilities, or conducting research. Suggestions for improving critical listening are
to listen as if you had to grade it, take notes to help recall the main points, ask questions to evaluate
the intellectual content of the message, and maximize the use of the time by first understanding
the message and then evaluating the information. Empathic Listening. Empathic listening is often useful when communication is emotional or
when the relationship between speaker and listener is just as important as the message. Use this
type of listening as somewhat of a prerequisite to informational or critical listening. Empathic
listening is often appropriate during mentoring and counseling sessions and is very helpful when
communicating with family members. <!-- Page 300 -->

## Section 15F — Electronic Messaging B B C C C

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**
Chapter 15—DEVELOPING SELF SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
### E-mail Etiquette
E-mail is defined as the electronic transmission of information over computer-based messaging
systems. Technological advancements have increased opportunities for more timely, efficient, and
effective communications, resulting in the explosive growth of e-mail use throughout the USAF. To uphold a commitment to secure messaging, the USAF has established guidelines to be used by
all USAF members. Rule 1: Be Clear and Concise. Make sure the subject line communicates your purpose. Be
specific and avoid ambiguous titles. Lead with the most important information. If the goal is to
answer a question, then reiterate the question at the top of the page. Use topic sentences if the email has multiple paragraphs. Be brief and to the point. Use bold, italic, or color when necessary
to emphasize key points. Choose readable fonts, 12 point or larger when possible. Rule 2: Watch Your Tone. Be polite. Think of the message as a personal conversation. Be
careful with humor, irony, and sarcasm. Electronic postings are perceived much more harshly than
they are intended, mainly because the receiver cannot see the sender’s body language, hear the
tone of voice, or observe any other nonverbal cues that could help interpret the intent of the
communication. Do not write using all CAPITAL letters—this is the e-mail equivalent of shouting
and is considered rude. Keep the e-mail clean and professional. E-mail is easily forwarded. Harassing, intimidating, abusive, or offensive material is unacceptable. Rule 3: Be Selective About What Message You Send. Do not discuss controversial, sensitive, classified, personal, Privacy Act, or controlled unclassified information that requires special
handling. Remember operations security, even unclassified information, when brought together
with other information, can create problems when in the wrong hands. Do not create or forward
junk mail, do not create or send chain letters, and do not use e-mail for personal ads. Rule 4: Be Selective About Who Gets Your Message. Reply to specific addressees to give those
not interested a break, in other words, only use “reply all” sparingly. Get permission before using
large mail groups. Double-check the address before mailing, especially when selecting from a
global list where many people have similar last names. Rule 5: Check Your Attachments and Support Material. Ensure all information is provided
as intended in your message to keep from having to send a follow-up e-mail. Before sending, ensure you have attached the attachments; this is a very common mistake. When applicable, cite
all quotes, references, and sources, as required under copyright and license agreements. Rule 6: Keep Your E-mail Under Control. Lock or sign off the computer when you leave your
workstation. If possible, create mailing lists to save time. Read and delete files daily. Create an
organized directory on your hard drive to keep mailbox files at a minimum. Ensure record copies
are properly identified and stored in an approved filing system. Acknowledge important or
sensitive messages with a courtesy reply to sender. When away from your e-mail for an extended
period of time, consider setting up an “auto reply” message. 15.33. Government Communication Systems
Government-provided messaging systems are for official use and limited authorized personal use
only. All government communications systems are subject to monitoring, interception, search, and
<!-- Page 301 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
301
seizure for all authorized purposes. Individuals must understand that they may be held responsible
for the content of their electronic messages and must ensure that messages adhere to acceptable
use of internet-based capabilities. Individuals are responsible for maintaining sent and received
information according to USAF records management directives. Electronic messages may be
subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, litigation, and court orders. Be sure to
adhere to local policy when sending electronic messages to mail distribution lists. Do not autoforward electronic messages from the.mil domain to a commercial internet service provider and
do not indiscriminately release electronic messaging addresses to the public. Identity Management. A vital element for messaging security is the implementation of public
key infrastructure and common access cards for identity management. Public key infrastructure
allows for the authentication of the sender identity using a digital signature and the
encryption/decryption of the message. Users of Department of Defense electronic messaging are
directed to follow current guidance for the use of public key infrastructure to sign and encrypt email. Defense Message System. The defense message system is the core messaging system of record
for the Department of Defense and the USAF. The defense message system is a flexible, commercial, off-the-shelf based application that provides messaging services to all Department of
Defense users (including deployed tactical users), and interfaces with other U.S. Government
agencies, branches of service, and defense contractors. Air Force Organizational Messaging. Organization simple mail transfer protocol mailboxes may
be used for all organizational messaging requirements unless usage of the defense message system
is required in support of CCMD responsibilities. Privacy Act Information. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires agencies to provide safeguards to
ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect individuals against an invasion of
personal privacy. Exercise caution before transmitting personal information over e-mail to ensure
the message is adequately safeguarded. When information is sensitive and personal, e-mail is not
the proper way for transmitting this information. When sending personal information over e-mail
within the Department of Defense, ensure there is an official need, and all addressees are
authorized to receive personal information under the Privacy Act. “Controlled unclassified
information” is added to the beginning of the subject line, followed by the subject. The following
statement is applied at the beginning of the e-mail: “This e-mail contains controlled unclassified
information which must be protected under The Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.” Do not
indiscriminately apply this statement to e-mails. Use only in situations when you are actually
transmitting personal information. 15.34. The Internet
Use of the web or web-based technologies is a technique for obtaining and disseminating
information worldwide. The web or internet provides the capability of quickly and efficiently
disseminating information to, and accessing information from, a variety of governmental and
nongovernmental sources. Web content must be managed in compliance with all information
management policies and procedures. Use of Internet Resources by Government Employees. The internet provides an indispensable
source for information from a variety of governmental and nongovernmental sources. The USAF’s
goal, within acceptable risk levels, is to provide maximum accessibility to internet resources for
personnel requiring access for official business. <!-- Page 302 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
