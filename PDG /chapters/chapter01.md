### 1.1. Professionalism

The dictionary defines a professional as one who "engages in something specific as their main occupation rather than a pastime." Other adjectives used to describe a professional are "competent," "assured," and "skillful." Professionalism describes who we are as a service and how we conduct ourselves as Airmen and representatives of the USAF. It sets the standards all Airmen are expected to adhere to—and exceed. Professionalism within the USAF is framed by the requirements of trust, loyalty, dignity, and personal commitment. We must be dependable and responsible for our own actions while being good wingmen for fellow Airmen and colleagues. At the root of professionalism is respect. Respect is what bonds every Airman's contribution to the mission with the collective understanding of what it means to serve with humility and respect for those we serve with.

The USAF is a Total Force that effectively leverages the unique capabilities of officer, enlisted, and civilian Airmen across RegAF, Guard, Reserve, and Auxiliary Components. As a Total Force, we are a values-based, mission-focused, people-oriented air force. Professionalism is the heart and soul of who we are and who we aspire to be every day. Our sense of professionalism underlies the pride we feel when we say, "I am an American Airman."

**Professional Obligation and Status.** Every Airman has an obligation to be the very best professional possible. As stated in AFI 1-1, the USAF has a very important national defense mission; and you, as a member of the USAF, have serious responsibilities for carrying out that mission. You are responsible for following orders, performing specific daily tasks related to your duties, and living up to the high standards of the USAF. Maintaining good order and discipline is paramount for mission accomplishment.

Professional status is expressed by attitudes and commitments, and by internalizing military values which can come to people at different times in their lives and careers. Studying and understanding these factors are vital to Airmen and the future of the USAF. Professional military members of today and tomorrow must accept responsibility for their actions, hold others accountable, and take appropriate action to never hide behind excuses. Focus must be directed toward devoted service to the nation, not on pay or the next assignment. Our Air Force is a critical part of the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. It is powered by the greatest Airmen the world has ever seen.

**Mission-Focused.** As Airmen, we stand ready, performing selfless duty in defense of our nation. We, and our families, are dedicated to answering our nation's call, making sacrifices for the good of the mission. We, as Airmen, must have the courage to take appropriate risks when necessary.

**People-Oriented.** Our most important resource is people. Taking care of our wingmen is our duty. We are an integrated force—strong, able, and ready. We, as Airmen, value the contribution of every member and motivate each other to achieve excellence. We also have a duty to develop and empower leaders. We honor and respect all who serve, and when we strengthen our alliances—we are stronger together.

Section 1B—Profession of Arms B B C C C

### 1.2. Profession of Arms

No profession asks more of its members than the profession of arms. As stated in our Airman's Creed, we have answered our nation's call. It is a higher calling, and it comes with a higher standard. As the pacing threats of our strategic competitors continue to grow and evolve, it's crucial all Airmen understand how their profession connects with our mission of national security and defense of the homeland.

General Ronald Fogleman, our 15th Air Force Chief of Staff, once said, "We are not engaged in just another job; we are practitioners of the profession of arms. We are entrusted with the security of our nation, the protection of our citizens and the preservation of its way of life. In this capacity, we serve as guardians of America's future. By its very nature, this responsibility requires us to place the needs of our service and our country before personal concerns." That responsibility was given to each and every Airman who raised their right hand and swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. When we joined our USAF with a sacred oath, we accepted a sacred trust from the American people, one that goes beyond anything else in society. As members of a joint team, our profession is distinguished from others because of our expertise in the justified application of lethal military force and the willingness of those who pay the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. No other profession expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends, families, or freedoms... but it's what our profession readily expects.

## Section 1C — Air Force Core Values

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**  
Chapter 1—PROFESSIONALISM SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt  
Section 1C—Air Force Core Values C C C C C

### 1.3. Air Force Core Values

At the heart and soul of our profession, the USAF recognizes our core values as universal, consistent standards used to evaluate the ethical climate of all USAF organizations. When needed in the cauldron of war, core values are the beacons that light the path of professional conduct and the highest ideals.

**Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do**

Values represent enduring, guiding principles for which we stand. Values, such as the USAF core values of integrity, service, and excellence, should motivate attitudes and actions on and off duty as essential moral principles or beliefs that are held in the highest regard. Our core values represent the USAF's firm convictions about the nature of our personal character, our commitment to each other and our nation, and the manner in which we perform our service. Core values are so fundamental that they define our very identity through a common bond among all professional Airmen—past and present. Being a part of our proud USAF community requires a commitment to living by these values at all times.

Reflecting the USAF core values in one's personal and professional lives is a challenge that must be faced every day. In doing so, we honor the heritage and continue the legacy of those who served before us and sacrificed so much. It is through this alignment of our actions with these values that we, as a USAF, earn the public's trust, strengthen our service, and accomplish our mission. This is the expectation of our profession and is the standard that our fellow service members and the American public hold us to.

**Virtues of Core Values**

Each of the USAF core values is further defined by virtues (desired behaviors and characteristics) we must practice and demonstrate in our daily lives, showing we truly do value integrity, service, and excellence. Consistently practicing these virtues results in habits of honorable thought and action, producing a USAF professional. USAF professionalism is a shared belief in, and a commitment to, honorable service based on our USAF core values.

#### 1.3.1. Integrity First

Integrity provides the bedrock for our military endeavors and is fortified by service to country. Integrity encompasses many characteristics indispensable to Airmen and makes us who we are and what we stand for. It is the compass that keeps us on the right path when we are confronted with ethical challenges and personal temptations, and it is the foundation upon which trust, and respect are built. Integrity is simply doing the right thing, all the time, whether everyone is watching, or no one is watching. An individual realizes integrity when thoughts and actions align with what he or she knows to be right. Following principles, acting with honor, maintaining independent judgment, and performing duties with impartiality, help to maintain integrity and avoid conflicts of interest.

"The foundation of our Profession of Arms is, and has always been, respect. That is a non-negotiable principle that supports the Integrity, Service and Excellence of our great Air Force. It is the cornerstone of the culture we need in our Air Force."

**CMSAF JoAnne S. Bass**  
19th Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force

**Virtues of Integrity.** The virtues of Integrity First are honesty, courage, and accountability.

**Honesty.** Honesty is the hallmark of integrity. As public servants, we are trusted agents. Honesty requires us to evaluate our performance against standards, and to conscientiously and accurately report findings. Our word must be unquestionable. This is the only way to preserve the trust and respect that we hold so dear for one another and the population we serve.

**Courage.** Courage is not the absence of fear but doing the right thing despite fear. Courage empowers us to take necessary personal or professional risks, make decisions that may be unpopular, and admit our mistakes. Having the courage to take these actions is crucial for the mission, the USAF, and the nation.

**Accountability.** Accountability instills our responsibility while maintaining transparency and ownership for our actions, whether it is the American people, our units, our supervisors, our fellow Airmen, our families, our loved ones, and even ourselves. Accountable individuals maintain transparency, seek honest and constructive feedback, and take ownership of the outcomes of their actions and decisions.

#### 1.3.2. Service Before Self

Service Before Self represents an abiding dedication to the age-old military virtue of selfless dedication to duty, including putting one's life at risk if called to do so. Service Before Self tells us that professional duties take precedence over personal desires. Airmen are practitioners of the profession of arms, entrusted with the security of the nation, the protection of its citizens, and the preservation of their way of life. In this capacity, Airmen serve as guardians of America's future, and this responsibility requires the needs of service and country to be placed before our own. In today's world, service to country requires not only a high degree of skill, but also a willingness to make personal sacrifices. It requires having the heart and mindset for service that allows us to embrace expectations and requirements not levied on the American public or other professions.

**Virtues of Service Before Self.** The virtues of Service Before Self are duty, loyalty, and respect.

**Duty.** Duty is the obligation to perform what is required for the mission. While our responsibilities are determined by the law, the Department of Defense, and USAF instructions, directives, and guidance, our sense of duty is a personal one and bound by the oath of service we took as individuals. Duty sometimes calls for sacrifice in ways no other profession has or will. Airmen who truly embody Service Before Self consistently choose to make necessary sacrifices to accomplish the mission, and in doing so, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

**Loyalty.** Loyalty is an internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger than ourselves. Our loyalty is to the nation first, the values and commitments of our USAF second, and finally to the men and women with whom we serve. Loyalty to our leaders requires us to trust, follow, and execute their decisions, even when we disagree. We offer alternative solutions and innovative ideas most effectively through the chain of command. Leaders demonstrate loyalty by respecting those who serve and treating them with dignity, compassion, and true concern for their well-being and professional development. Ultimately, loyalty is demonstrated by helping each other act with respect and honor.

**Respect.** Respect encompasses self-respect, mutual respect, and organizational respect. We must honor the USAF and others by following our words with actions.

#### 1.3.3. Excellence In All We Do

Excellence In All We Do directs us to develop a sustained passion for the continuous improvement and innovation that propels the USAF, as well as ourselves, beyond the capabilities of our adversaries. Excellence In All We Do does not mean that we demand perfection in everything from everyone. But rather, it means we continuously advance our craft and increase our knowledge as Airmen. Excellence In All We Do means that Airmen seek out opportunities and complete developmental education; constantly work hard to stay in physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and moral shape; continue to enhance professional competencies; and are diligent to maintain their job skills, knowledge, and personal readiness at the highest possible levels. We must have a passion for deliberate continuous improvement and innovation that propels the USAF to accelerate change or lose now.

**Virtues of Excellence In All We Do.** The virtues of Excellence In All We Do are mission, discipline, and teamwork.

**Mission.** Mission focus encompasses operations and excellence in stewardship. The complex undertaking of the USAF mission requires us to harness the ingenuity, expertise, and elbow grease of all Airmen. We approach it with the mindset of respect, pride, innovation, and a continued commitment to anticipate and embrace change. Our work areas, our processes, and our interpersonal interactions must be undeniably professional and positive. Our people are the platform for delivering continuous process improvements, innovative ideas, strategies, and technologies to the overall mission.

**Discipline.** Discipline is an individual commitment to uphold the highest of personal and professional standards. We demonstrate it in attitude, work ethic, and effort directed at continuous improvement, whether pursuing professional military education or nurturing ourselves physically, intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually. Our appearance, actions, professionalism, and words, spoken and written, represent the USAF and shape our USAF culture and the reputation of the entire military profession.

**Teamwork.** Teamwork is essential to triumph at every level. Airmen recognize the interdependency of every member's contribution toward the mission and strive for organizational excellence. We not only give our personal best, but also challenge and motivate each other to give their best. We gain respect through our actions and strong work ethic to build team trust. We carry our own weight, and whenever necessary, help our wingmen carry theirs.

## Section 1D — Ethical Standards

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**  
Chapter 1—PROFESSIONALISM SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt  
Section 1D—Ethical Standards B B C C C

### 1.4. Code of Ethics

As a member of the USAF, you must practice the highest standards of conduct and integrity, not only in your job, but also in your relationships, personal financial dealings, and interactions with the civilian community. Whereas moral values describe what we hold to be right and wrong, ethics is the systematic reflection of these values enabling us to live and act according to our beliefs. Although following the law is ethical, laws only tell us what we can and cannot do. Ethics, on the other hand, tells us what we should or shouldn't do. Thus, Airmen must follow the law, but simply doing so is not enough. Airmen must also develop a code of ethics such that your behavior and motives do not create even the appearance of impropriety while providing a larger standard to live up to. Your commitment to integrity and excellence will lead the way for others to follow.

Nonetheless, personal values, such as happiness or stability, while almost always present, must not take precedence over USAF's ethical values. The key is to align ethical values with personal values and enhance the commitment we have made to the dedicated service of our nation. Our ethical code is prescribed in our core values, our oaths, the Airman's Creed, Professions of Arms, DoD and USAF guidance, Joint Ethics Regulation, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. When faced with decisions related to mission, personal life, or the interest of peers, the choice can always be made with consideration for our ethical code.

**Principles and Guidelines.** Embedded in our code of ethics, and driven by our competence and character, are key guidelines that help clarify acceptable and unacceptable behavior, but also aspirational values about who we want to be. Principles and ethical guidelines can be used to help identify what right looks like and continue to fortify our USAF culture.

Title 5, CFR, Part 2635, Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, establishes the basic ethical principles and guidelines that must be followed by every government employee. A few examples of ethical expectations outlined in the regulation are provided here.

- Public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, and ethical principles, above private gain.
- Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty.
- Employees shall not solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business with, or conducting activities regulated by the employee's agency, or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties.
- Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises of any kind purporting to bind the government.
- Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any non-Federal entity (including installation-recognized private organization) or individual.
- Employees shall protect and conserve federal property and shall not use it for other than authorized activities.
- Employees shall satisfy, in good faith, their obligations as citizens, including all just financial obligations, especially federal, state, or local taxes that are imposed by law.

Employees may generally not accept gifts from subordinates or employees that make less pay than themselves. Employees may not solicit a donation or a contribution from other personnel for a gift to a superior, make a donation for a gift to a superior official, or accept a gift from subordinate personnel, except for voluntary gifts or contributions of nominal value (not to exceed $10), on occasions of special personal significance (such as marriage or birth of a child), or occasions that terminate the superior-subordinate relationship, such as retirement, permanent change of station or assignment.

#### 1.4.1. Ethical Dilemma

An ethical dilemma is a situation where one is forced to choose between at least two alternatives. Three general causes or sources of ethical dilemmas are: uncertainty, competing values, and potential harm.

**Uncertainty** is the result of not having all the facts pertaining to a situation; not having enough experience for dealing with a situation; or not having a clearly established policy, procedure, or rules for deciding how to make an optimal decision.

**Competing values** occur when our personal values conflict with those of our institution, subordinates, peers, or supervisors; however, the mark of a true professional is maintaining high professional standards despite conflicting values by locating the conflicting values, weighing one's options, and deciding upon the best course of action.

**Potential harm** relates to the intentional and unintentional short and long-term consequences caused by our actions.

**Decisions and Actions.** As Airmen, we should always think through second and third order effects of our actions. We must apply a sense of order to our priorities, so we are able to overcome temptation to stray from our military norms and values. When contemplating what to do, consider possible courses of action by listing the best options and quality checking ideas to take the right path. When possible, take the decision process to the next level and put each course of action to the test.

Dr. Robert M. Hicks, former Deputy Director of the Civil Air Patrol, Chaplain Services, identified three tests we can use to check the morality of our actions and decisions:

**The Network Test.** The network test consists of asking yourself, "How would this decision look if it was aired on the news or social media?" If your actions were broadcast on the evening news, would you be proud of your actions or ashamed? Would your actions bring credit to yourself and the USAF or would they discredit yourself or those we owe? If you find yourself leaning toward a negative response to these questions, then your decision doesn't pass the network test.

**The United States of America Test.** The United States of America test focuses on asking yourself, "Is this decision good for the United States? Is this decision good for the USAF? Is this decision good for my unit (us)? Is this decision good for me?" If you take this course of action, are you properly ordering your priorities? If you can't answer with a resounding yes, this might not be the best decision.

**The Divine Test.** The divine test deals with asking yourself, "Would I feel good about the decision when I give account for my life?" When telling the story of your proud and honorable service to our country, would you include conversation about this decision? Would you feel guilt or loss of trust from this action? If you can't confidently provide a positive response, the course of action fails the divine test.

#### 1.4.2. Honorable Characteristics

Airmen share a history of valor, courage, and sacrifice. From the earliest days of airpower to the heights of space, Airmen have built an extraordinary heritage that forms the foundation for a boundless horizon. We are technology focused, we embrace change, and through transformation and innovation, we ensure a viable USAF for the future.

Always keep focus on demonstrating honorable service and commitment to the profession of arms. Through skills, knowledge, and experience developed in the USAF, listen to your internal compass while fostering the same in your peers. Remind yourself and your peers of the reason you do what you do. Declare the importance of serving for a higher cause, adhering to established ethical codes, and embracing a USAF culture steeped in honor and tradition. Rely on what you know is true and what is right. Be the Airman who makes decisions and leads in a way you can be proud of.

Airmen firmly grounded in the core values react to stresses, operational deployment pressures, and daily home station demands with valor, courage, and sacrifice. While many acts of valor, courage, or sacrifice go unseen, they should be recognized not only as part of USAF culture, but also to illustrate that any Airman may be called upon at any time to perform above and beyond in the profession of arms.

**Valor.** Valor is the ability to face danger or hardship in a determined and resolute manner. Valor is commonly and rightly recognized as bravery, fearlessness, fortitude, gallantry, heart, and nerve. When acting with valor, one expresses the willingness to step outside the comfort zone to deal with unexpected situations. Such situations can happen almost anywhere. In addition to demonstrating valor on the battlefield, an Airman can exhibit valor when presented with unusual circumstances in the daily routine of life and take intelligent risks.

**Courage.** Courage is about the ability to face fear, danger, or adversity. Three types of courage are critical in the profession of arms: personal, physical, and moral. Personal courage is about doing what's right even when risking one's career. Physical courage is the ability to overcome fears of bodily harm to get the job done, or willingness to risk harm to yourself for someone else's sake in battle or the course of everyday life. Finally, moral courage is the ability to stand by the core values when moral courage may not be the popular thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when and where the behavior is most needed. Often, courage is manifested as an act of bravery on the battlefield when Airmen face the challenges present in combat.

**Sacrifice.** Sacrifice involves a willingness to give your time, comfort, or life to meet others' needs. Personal sacrifices occur whenever Airmen put others' needs before individual wants, whether in combat, at home station, or in the local community.

**Call to Duty.** When Americans commit to service, the USAF takes on the charge to develop them into Airmen. Over the next 30 years, the USAF's ability to continue to adapt and respond faster than our potential adversaries will depend on the flexibility and adaptability of our current and next generation Airmen. We will recruit, develop, and retain exceptional Airmen through strategies and programs designed to develop and care for our Total Force, strengthen the USAF culture, and leverage development opportunities that employ creative concepts across the force.

When faced with the call to duty, we must remember that we are Airmen. As Airmen, we understand the price that is paid for freedom and the sacrifices that come from willing service to our country. We understand the meaning of belonging to the profession of arms.

### 1.5. The Airman's Creed

The Airman's Creed was presented to the USAF in 2007 by General T. Michael Moseley, 18th Air Force Chief of Staff. General Moseley introduced the creed as an aspect of one of his top priorities to reinvigorate the Total Force. The intent of the creed was to enhance the building of a warrior ethos among Airmen and establish a coherent bond between the members of the USAF.

**THE AIRMAN'S CREED**

I am an American Airman.  
Guardian of Freedom and Justice, My Nation's Sword and Shield, Its Sentry and Avenger.
