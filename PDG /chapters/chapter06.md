### Doctrine Defined
Every Airman needs doctrine to fundamentally understand how he or she contributes to making
our Air Force the best in the world. It tells us how to effectively and efficiently apply airpower to
help defend our nation. We should understand that doctrine is the Airman's inheritance, passed
down from Airmen before us. It is our warfighting legacy. Doctrine tells us who we are and why
our Air Force exists. Doctrine is the distilled warfighting experience and knowledge of our Air
Force heroes, leaders, theorists, and scholars. Most importantly, doctrine captures and crystallizes
the warfighting lessons. It is our responsibility to continually improve USAF doctrine through
experience and debate, so we can pass down our best practices and our lessons learned to
tomorrow's Airmen. “I’m firmly convinced that leaders are not born; they’re educated, trained, and made, as in every other profession. To ensure a strong, ready USAF, we must always remain
dedicated to this process.”
General Curtis E. LeMay, CSAF, 1961-1965
A general discussion of Air Force doctrine can be found in the Doctrine Primer on the LeMay
Center’s doctrine https://www.doctrine.af.mil/. Fundamentals of Doctrine. Military service is based on values that experience has proven to be
vital for operational success. The complexity of integrating fighting elements according to
doctrine, and the uncertainty inherent in rapidly developing contingency operations, demands that
planning and employment be understood and repeatable. Meeting the challenges of this rapidly
changing world requires understanding and application of doctrine. Doctrine exists as joint
doctrine, multinational doctrine, and Service doctrine. Joint Doctrine. The growing threats to United States and allied interests throughout the world
demand U.S. Armed Forces be proficient across the competition continuum. The fundamental
principles that guide joint operations are recorded in joint doctrine. The purpose of joint doctrine
is to enhance the effectiveness of joint operations by providing fundamental principles that guide
the employment and integration of the U.S. military to create unity of effort and unity of
command. Joint doctrine promotes a common perspective from which to plan, train, and conduct
joint military operations. The foundations of joint doctrine represent what is taught, believed, and
advocated for (what is right and what works best). Joint operations are conducted routinely and efficiently in the current operational environment. To
maintain and enhance this efficiency, joint leaders must diligently study, apply, teach, and
ultimately provide insights to improve joint doctrine. JP 1 Volume 1, Joint Warfighting, Reference Copy, provides fundamental principles and overarching guidance for the U.S. Armed
Forces and forms the core for our forces to be able to fight as a unified force—a joint team. Joint
doctrine is official advice and will be followed, except when in the judgment of the commander
or exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise. Multinational Doctrine. Some nations possess doctrine and training programs with a full

treatment of strategic, operational, and tactical issues. Other nations have doctrine and training
programs smaller in both scope and capability to match their national goals and objectives. Multinational doctrine, as it applies to airpower, describes the best way to integrate and employ
USAFs with the forces of allies in coalition warfare. It establishes principles, organization, and
fundamental procedures agreed upon between or among Allied Forces. When developed as a result
of a treaty, as in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), multinational doctrine is directive. When the U.S. Armed Forces participate in multinational operations, our commanders follow
multinational doctrine and ratified (approved) procedures. For multinational doctrine and
procedures not ratified by the United States, commanders should evaluate and follow multinational
command doctrine and procedures where applicable and consistent with law, policy, and guidance. Service Doctrine. Our service doctrine, USAF doctrine (https://www.doctrine.af.mil/), is
developed by the Curtis E. LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education at Maxwell
Air Force Base, Alabama. Our doctrine provides best practices for organization, planning, and
employment of global airpower. As airpower capabilities improve, Airmen must also incorporate
new concepts, lessons learned, and technologies into our development and application processes. Note: The LeMay Center traces its lineage to the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field, Virginia. Through a series of changes in name and location, the school evolved into the doctrine
development center of the Air Corps and became a preparatory school for Air Corps officers
aspiring to attend the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College. In 1946, the Army Air
Force created the Air University to continue with the Air Corps Tactical School objectives. Today, the LeMay Center serves as the CSAF’s Principal Agent for Doctrine and provides doctrine
development expertise for the entire USAF. 6.2. Levels of USAF Doctrine
Airpower is never prosecuted alone, and not one military contingency or operation, whether in
peacetime or wartime, can optimize its objective without space or cyberspace. The proper
application of airpower requires a comprehensive doctrine of employment and an Airman’s
perspective. Information addressed in USAF doctrine, whether directly or indirectly, applies to
Airmen on a daily basis. Lessons presented in doctrine, while written for the purpose of
understanding warfighting, often can be applied under a range of contexts that enhance decisionmaking and strengthen leadership across the USAF. USAF doctrine is addressed at three levels: basic, operational, and tactical. These levels speak to the intellectual content of the doctrine. Basic Doctrine. Basic doctrine, contained in Air Force Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 1, The Air
Force, is the USAF’s premier statement of our beliefs and the cornerstone upon which our Service
identity is based. Basic doctrine states the most fundamental and enduring beliefs that describe
and guide the proper use, presentation, and organization of forces in military action. Basic doctrine
describes the “elemental properties” of airpower and provides the Airman’s perspective. Because
of its fundamental and enduring character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing guidance
on how our USAF is organized, employed, equipped, and sustained. Because it expresses broad, enduring fundamentals, basic doctrine changes relatively slowly compared to the other levels of
doctrine. The focal points of AFDP 1 are the reason we exist as a USAF (why we fight), Airmen
as the leaders and innovators (who we are), airpower as the ability to project military power in, from and through the air (what we do), and the tenets of airpower which are the fundamental truths
of how to apply airpower (how we do it). As the foundation of all doctrine, basic doctrine sets the
tone and vision for doctrine development for the future. Operational Doctrine. Operational doctrine, contained in all the additional AFDPs, describes
detailed organization of forces, and applies the principles of basic doctrine to military actions. The primary audience for operational doctrine COMAFFOR and their staff supporting a joint

force commander (JFC). Operational doctrine guides the proper organization and employment of
airpower forces in the context of distinct objectives, force capabilities, broad functional areas, and
operational environments. Operational doctrine provides the focus for developing the missions
and tasks to be executed through tactical doctrine. Doctrine at this level is managed by the LeMay
Center and changes are made IAW AFI 10-1301, Air Force Doctrine Development, and AFPD
10-13, Air Force Doctrine. Tactical Doctrine. Tactical doctrine describes the proper employment of specific USAF assets, individually or in concert with other assets, to accomplish detailed objectives. Tactical doctrine
considers particular objectives, such as stopping the advance of an armored column; conditions, such as threats, weather, and terrain; and employment of USAF assets. USAF tactical doctrine is
codified as tactics, techniques, and procedures in Air Force -3 series manuals, many of which are
classified due to their sensitive nature. Because tactical doctrine is closely associated with the
employment of technology and emerging tactics, change will likely occur more rapidly than other
levels of doctrine. Tactical doctrine is developed at multiple locations in the USAF: the 561st
Weapons Squadron, the 423d Mobility Training Squadron, and the Air Land Sea Space
Applications Center; it can also be developed by an Air Staff office or a major command. 6.3. Uses of Doctrine
Understanding the underlying technique used to structure doctrine helps amplify the point that
doctrine should be written robustly, but broadly, allowing decision-makers latitude in
interpretation and flexibility in application, yet it should be specific enough to provide informed
guidance. Understanding how doctrine is structured also illustrates the use of doctrine in
explaining contentious issues and how doctrine can be used to focus thoughts and strategies more
effectively through applying the best means of integrating various aspects of military power and
organization. Key principles of doctrine are provided here. Warfighting, not Physics. The warfighting does not physic principle specifically addresses the
perceived differences between operations in air and cyberspace. Air and cyberspace are separate
domains requiring exploitation of different sets of physical laws but are linked by the effects they
can produce when integrated. For example, Airmen should be more concerned with the best means
of employing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, rather than whether a
platform is airborne or in orbit. Effects, not Platforms. The effects, not platforms principle focuses on the desired outcome of a
particular action more so than on the system or weapon that provides the effect. The effects-based
approach to operations begins with clear military objectives and the statement of desired endstates. USAF doctrine does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific tasks or effects. Whether a B-52 or an F-16 accomplishes a given task or whether a platform is manned or
unmanned is not nearly as important as the outcome of the mission. Using Domains, not Owning Domains. The using domains, not owning domains principle
illustrates the importance of properly conducting operations in a domain to obtain the best
warfighting effects, not of carving up the battlespace based on Service or functional parochialism
(narrow-mindedness). Focusing on using forces within a domain is a vital first step to integration
of efforts. Arguments over ownership eventually lead to suboptimal application of efforts at the
expense of the larger, total effort. <!-- Page 112 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
112
Organization, not Organizations. The organization, not organizations principle refers to modern
warfare demands that different Services, different nations, and differing functions within a single
Service often need to be brought together intelligently to achieve unity of command and unity of
effort. Doctrine explains why certain organizational structures are preferred over others and
describes effective command relationships and command authorities; this facilitates the rapid
standup of joint and Service organizations during rapidly evolving situations. Ultimately, doctrine
is not about whether one particular element of a joint force is more decisive than another, nor about
suggesting that one element serve as the centerpiece of joint operations: it’s the total, tailored force
that’s decisive. Synergy, not Segregation. The synergy, not segregation principle acknowledges that segregation
guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. To allow synergy, Airmen
should have access to the entire theater of operations to maximize the ability to achieve objectives; access should not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire control measures. A synergistic mindset opens the battlespace areas of operation and allows maximization of use of
scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities and enhances combat effectiveness. Integration, not just Synchronization. The integration, not just synchronization principle
addresses the value of integration over synchronization. Synchronization is defined as “the
arrangement of military actions in time, space, and purpose to produce maximum relative combat
power at a decisive place and time.” Integration, by comparison, is defined as “the arrangement of
military forces and their actions to create a force that operates by engaging as a whole.”
Synchronization emphasizes timing, while integration considers priority and effect to be both
efficient and effective with scarce resources. The Right Force, not just Equal Shares of the Force. The right force, not just equal shares of
the force principle address the JP 1 Volume 1 statement that the integration of Joint Forces is
designed to address both functional and geographic vulnerabilities, but forces will be selected
based on those who can provide the capabilities needed in each operation. As one senior USAF
officer said, “Joint warfighting is not like Little League baseball, where everybody gets a chance
to play.” Any given joint force should be tailored appropriately for the task at hand. Some
operations will be land- centric, others air-centric, others maritime-, cyberspace-, or informationcentric. The composition of the joint force and the tasks assigned to various elements should reflect
the needs of the mission. 6.4. Principles of Joint Operations
Throughout the history of conflict, military leaders have noted certain principles that produce
victory. Known today as the principles of joint operations, these aspects of warfare are found to
be universally true and relevant. As members of the joint team, Airmen should appreciate how
these principles apply to all forces but should most fully understand them as they pertain to the
USAF. Airpower provides unique capabilities, no matter which Service operates the systems, and
no matter which type of platform is used. These principles of joint operations serve as guidance
for leaders to evaluate potential courses of action. No one principle should be considered without
due consideration of the others. The principles of joint operations, combined with the additional
tenets of airpower (addressed in the next section), provide the basis for a sound and enduring
doctrine for the air and cyberspace forces of America’s joint force. The principles of joint
operations, as discussed in JP 3-0, Joint Operations, are addressed here with a USAF perspective. The principles of joint operations are formed around the nine traditional principles of war. Three
additional principles—restraint, perseverance, and legitimacy—are relevant to how the Armed
Forces of the United States use combat power across the competition continuum. In addition, there is a specific principle of operations the USAF uses: unity of effort. <!-- Page 113 -->

Unity of Command. Unity of command is vital in employing airpower as it ensures appropriate
concentration and priority of effort by one responsible commander with the authority and the
capability to direct force employment in pursuit of common objectives. The USAF’s operationallevel perspective calls for unity of command to gain the most effective and efficient application of
airpower. Airpower is the product of multiple capabilities, and centralized command is essential
to effectively fuse these capabilities and provide unity of command. Economy of Force. Economy of force is the judicious employment and distribution of force by
selecting the best mix of airpower capabilities. To ensure overwhelming combat power is
available, appropriate effort should be devoted to primary objectives and allocate lesser essential
resources to secondary efforts. Economy of force may require a commander to establish a balance
in the application of airpower between attacking, defending, delaying, or conducting other
operations, such as information operations, based on the priority of the objectives. Also, priorities
may shift rapidly from one type of mission, such as interdiction, to another, such as close air
support. Although the principle of economy of force suggests the use of overwhelming force in
one sense, it also recommends against the use of more force than reasonably necessary. Maneuver. Maneuver places the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible
application of combat power in a multidimensional combat space. Airpower’s ability to conduct
maneuver is not only a product of its speed and range, but maneuverability is also obtained through
flexibility and versatility established during the planning and execution of operations. The
principle of maneuver allows potential engagement anywhere, from any direction, at any time, forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere. Applying the principle of maneuver will force
the enemy to react, allowing the exploitation of successful friendly operations and reducing
friendly vulnerabilities. Forward deployment of airpower assets is one example of maneuver that, by its very presence, can reassure allies and deter aggressors. Objective. The principle of objective is to direct military operations toward a defined and
attainable objective that contributes to established strategic, operational, and tactical goals. In a
broad sense, the principle of objective holds that political and military goals should be aligned and
clearly articulated. A clear national military strategy provides focus for defining campaign or
theater objectives, while at the operational level, campaign or theater objectives determine military
priorities. From the outset, airpower can pursue tactical, operational, or strategic objectives in any
combination, or all three simultaneously. From an Airman’s perspective, the principle of objective
shapes priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or campaign priorities and seeks to
avoid the siphoning of force elements to fragmented objectives. Security. The purpose of the principle of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire an
unexpected advantage. Critical to security is understanding that it embraces physical, operations, and information security. Security may be obtained by staying beyond the enemy’s reach, physically and virtually, as airpower is uniquely suited to operate over the horizon. Security from
physical and electronic intrusion conceals our capabilities and intentions, while allowing friendly
forces to gather information on the adversary. Security through force protection is an integral part
of protecting aircraft and fixed bases where they are especially vulnerable. Information is central
to securing the outcome of a conflict, particularly with today’s advanced communications and
computer technologies. Security ensures our capabilities of withstanding aerial, ground, and
cyberspace attacks while sustaining airpower activities against the enemy. Offensive. The purpose of an offensive action is to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative, our
initiative, as efficiently and effectively as possible. The offensive aim is to act rather than react
and to dictate the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of operations. While defensive
measures may be required at times, success in war is generally attained while on the offensive. All
<!-- Page 114 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
114
military forces have offensive capabilities, and airpower’s ability to mass, maneuver, and operate
independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of war, provides
global reach to directly and rapidly take the offensive and seize the initiative. Once seized, the
initiative should be retained and fully exploited. Through prompt and sustained offensive actions
designed to attain operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes the enemy to react rather
than act, denies them the offensive, and ultimately enables our forces to shape the conflict. Mass. Concentration of military power through mass is a fundamental consideration in all military
operations. Today’s airpower is uniquely capable of launching an attack from widely dispersed
locations and massing combat power at the objective, whether that objective is a single physical
location or widely dispersed enemy systems. Airpower, with speed, range, and flexibility, complemented by accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and advances in information
technologies, achieves mass through highly effective attack rather than overwhelming by
necessarily large numbers of forces. USAF cyberspace capabilities, often enabled by space
systems, allow dispersed forces to collaborate to rapidly find, fix, and track fleeting targets, and
mass a response with precise effects around the globe. Surprise. Surprise is one of airpower’s strongest advantages. Surprise leverages the principle of
security by attacking the enemy at a time, place, or in a manner for which they are not prepared. The speed and range of air and cyberspace capabilities, coupled with their flexibility and
versatility, enable the element of surprise, and enhance and empower other forces to achieve
surprise as well. The rapid global reach of airpower can enable surface forces to reach foreign
destinations quickly, capitalizing on surprise and thus seizing the initiative. Simplicity. Simplicity calls for avoiding unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, planning, and conducting military operations. Simplicity ensures that guidance, plans, and orders
are as simple and direct as a military objective allows. Simple guidance allows subordinate
CCDRs the freedom to operate creatively within their portion of the operational environment, supporting the concept of decentralized execution. Common equipment, a common understanding
of Service and joint doctrine, and familiarity with procedures through joint exercises and training, can help overcome complexity while
implementing straightforward plans, providing
unambiguous organization, and establishing clearly defined command relationships. Restraint. The purpose of restraint is to prevent the unnecessary use of force. Restraint requires
the careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security, the conduct of military operations, and the achievement of national objectives. Excessive force antagonizes those parties involved, thereby damaging the legitimacy of the organization that uses it while potentially enhancing the
legitimacy of the opposing party. Sufficiently detailed rules of engagement the commander tailors
to the specific circumstances of the operation can help facilitate appropriate restraint. Perseverance. The purpose of perseverance is to ensure the commitment necessary to achieve
national objectives. Perseverance involves preparation for measured, protracted military
operations in pursuit of national objectives. Some joint operations may require years to reach the
termination criteria. The patient, resolute, and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives is
essential to success. This will frequently involve diplomatic, economic, and informational
measures to supplement military efforts. Legitimacy. The purpose of legitimacy is to maintain legal and moral authority in the conduct of
operations. Legitimacy, which can be a decisive factor in operations, is based on the actual and
perceived legality, morality, and rightness of the actions from the various perspectives of interested
audiences. These audiences will include our national leadership and domestic population, governments and civilian populations in the operational area, partner nations and allies, and nations
<!-- Page 115 -->

and organizations around the world. 115
Unity of Effort (additional Air Force Principle, AFDP 1). The purpose of this principle is to
ensure that a wide range of components, agencies, and partners operating during a contingency
coordinate their actions and resources and focus on the same goal. This is a vital principle for the
USAF, especially when working in an interagency and multinational environment. 6.5. Tenets of Airpower
The application of airpower is refined by several fundamental guiding truths; these truths are
known as the tenets of airpower. The tenets of airpower reflect a unique historical and doctrinal
evolution of airpower, as well as a current appreciation for the nature of airpower. While
complementing the principles of joint operations, which provide general guidance on the
application of military forces, these tenets provide specific considerations for the employment of
airpower. These tenets require informed judgment in application and a skillful blending to tailor
them to the ever-changing operational environment. Airmen at all levels must accept the fact that
war is incredibly complex, and no two operations are identical. The tenets of airpower, as defined
in AFDP 1, are described here. Mission Command. The Airman’s philosophy for the command and control (C2) of airpower is
mission command. Mission command is an approach to C2 that empowers subordinate decisionmaking for flexibility, initiative, and responsiveness in the accomplishment of commander’s
intent. Mission command provides Airmen operating in environments of increasing uncertainty, complexity, and rapid change with the freedom of action needed to exploit emergent opportunities
and succeed. Given the global reach and strategic effects of airpower, the USAF’s approach to
mission command balances the need for tactical flexibility with the management of global risks. Airmen execute mission command through centralized command, distributed control, and
decentralized execution. Centralized command is the organizing standard for the effective and
efficient means of employing airpower; it enables the principle of mass while maintaining the
principle of economy of force. Because of airpower’s potential to directly affect the strategic and
operational levels of warfare, it should be commanded by a single Airman, the air component
commander. Distributed control exploits airpower’s flexibility and versatility to ensure that it
remains responsive, survivable, and sustainable. Decentralized execution is the delegation of
authority to achieve effective span of control, foster disciplined initiative, and empower
subordinates to exploit fleeting opportunities. Flexibility and Versatility. With flexibility and versatility, airpower has the potential to achieve
unmatched synergy through asymmetric and parallel operations. Flexibility allows airpower to
shift from one JFC objective to another, quickly and decisively; to re-role assets quickly from a
preplanned mission to support an unanticipated need. Versatility is the ability to employ airpower
effectively at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war and provide a wide variety of
tasks in concert with other joint elements. Cyberspace capabilities are especially able to
simultaneously support multiple taskings around the globe and support tasks at all levels of
warfare. Synergistic Effects. The proper, synergistic application of a coordinated force across multiple
domains can produce desired effects that exceed the contributions of forces otherwise employed
individually. Rather than causing the destruction of a large number of targets through attrition
warfare, the objective of achieving synergistic effects is the precise, coordinated application of the
various elements of airpower and surface power to bring disproportionate pressure upon enemy
leaders to comply with our national will (affecting their intent) or to cause functional defeat of the
enemy forces (affecting their capability). Airpower is unique in its ability to dictate the tempo and
<!-- Page 116 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
116
direction of an entire warfighting effort regardless of the scale of the operation. Persistence. Airpower operations may be conducted continuously against a broad spectrum of
targets, with persistence. Airpower’s exceptional speed and range allow its forces to visit and
revisit wide ranges of targets or territories nearly at will, and with resolve. Airpower does not have
to occupy terrain or remain constantly in proximity to areas of operation to bring a powerful
response. Unmanned aircraft systems offer similar possibilities from the atmosphere. Persistence keeps pressure on and denies the enemy the ability to circumvent strategic effects. Demonstrations of persistent operations could range from maintaining a continuous flow of
materiel to peacetime distressed areas; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities
monitoring adversaries; assuring targets are kept continually out of commission; or ensuring
resources and facilities are denied an enemy or provided to an ally during a specified time. The
end result would be to deny the opponent an opportunity to seize the initiative and to directly
accomplish assigned tasks. Concentration. One of the most constant and important trends throughout military history has
been the effort of applying concentrated, overwhelming power at the decisive time and place. Because the versatility of airpower, with its lethality, speed, and persistence, makes it an attractive
option for many tasks, the demand often exceeds the available forces. Without concentration of
efforts, fragmentation of the integrated airpower effort could occur in attempts to fulfill the many
demands of the mission. To prevent the triple risk of failing to achieve operational-level objectives, delaying, or diminishing the attainment of decisive effects, and increasing the attrition rate of the
force, Airmen should guard against the inadvertent dilution of airpower effects resulting from high
demand and maintain the capability of employing concentrated efforts when most applicable. Priority. The application of airpower should be balanced among its ability to conduct operations
at all levels of war, often simultaneously. Commanders of all components and all levels should
establish clear priorities for the use of airpower to effectively prioritize their requirements for
coordinated airpower effects. The air component commander should assess the possible uses of
component forces and their strengths and capabilities to support the overall joint campaign. Limited resources require that airpower be applied where it can make the greatest contribution to
the most critical current joint force commander requirements. Balance. Much of the skill of an air component commander is reflected in the dynamic and correct
balancing of the principles of joint operations and the tenets of airpower. An air component
commander should balance combat opportunity, necessity, effectiveness, efficiency, and the
impact on accomplishing assigned objectives against the associated risk to friendly forces. An
Airman is uniquely and best suited to determine the proper theater-wide balance between offensive
and defensive air operations, and among strategic, operational, and tactical applications. Airpower
assets are normally available only in finite numbers; thus, balance is a crucial determinant for
mission requirements. <!-- Page 117 -->

### The Joint Team
Airpower has demonstrated its success to meet our homeland and international security challenges
by leveraging our respective joint capabilities and maximizing synergistic results. Capabilities
such as cyberspace operations aim to guarantee our capability to operate in any contested
cyberspace domain to support vital land, maritime, air, and space missions by employing
capabilities to protect essential military cyberspace systems and to speed their recovery if an attack
does occur. In the increasingly interdependent warfighting domains, the USAF possesses unique
capabilities for ensuring global mobility; long-range strike; and effective intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. We now rarely see any one Service or even any one country unilaterally plan, organize, or execute
an operation. Instead, we see greater inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes interagency
partners, whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today’s complex environment. Through
this interdependence the joint force is able to select the right resources and capabilities from each
partner. These capabilities are not just used when a contingency arises but are synergized and
tested through such venues as exercises and peacetime operations to ensure all joint, interagency, and multinational partners can achieve the desired objectives at the right time and right place. Joint Operations. Although individual services may plan and conduct operations to accomplish
tasks and missions in support of Department of Defense objectives, the Department of Defense
more typically employs at least two services from at least two military departments in a single
operation, particularly in combat, through joint operations. A joint operation is the general term
used to describe military actions conducted by joint forces in specified command relationships. Joint operations include combat when necessary to achieve objectives at all levels of warfare. Based on the fundamental principles for joint command and control, joint forces are organized
for effective and efficient operations, and commanders are delegated the necessary command
authorities to plan, direct, and control their forces to accomplish assigned missions. Multinational Operations. As our nation and its armed forces are confronted with a multitude of
priorities, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to ensure that the right
capabilities are integrated, and that they are interoperable across all domains. Competing priorities
today must be carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality—not
necessarily quantity—smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, and agile response force. As
well, we must rely on the strengths of other national partners, while ensuring all capabilities are
interoperable to ensure we can achieve our overarching objectives. One of the first successful operational actions of combining joint and multinational forces was
experienced during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. These operations demonstrated
the value and effectiveness of joint and coalition military operations. The unique capabilities of
each of our military Services, and those of each of our partners, were exploited during various
phases of both operations. The coalition force provided a synergistic combat capability which
brought the greatest possible military power to bear against the opponent. Likewise, our experience
also reaffirmed the importance of joint and multinational training, the value of forward presence, and the validity of sequencing for power-projection. <!-- Page 118 -->

Unity of Command and Unity of Effort. Unity of command means all forces operate under a
single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common
purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and cooperation among all forces toward
a commonly recognized objective, although they are not necessarily part of the same command
structure. During multinational operations and interagency coordination, unity of command may
not be possible, but the requirement for unity of effort becomes paramount. Unity of effort –
coordination through cooperation and common interests – is an essential complement to unity of
command. Note: One of the founding initiatives which addressed joint interdependence and joint
interoperability was the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. 6.7. Command Authorities
Combatant Command (Command Authority). Combatant command (command authority), abbreviated as COCOM, is the authority of a CCDR to perform functions of command over
assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations, joint training (or in the case of U.S. Special Operations Command, training of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to the command. It cannot be
delegated or transferred. Operational Control. Operational control (OPCON) is inherent in COCOM and is the authority
to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and
employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative
direction necessary to accomplish the mission. OPCON is the command authority that may be
exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD and may be delegated
within the command. While OPCON includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military
operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command, it does
not include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal
organization, or unit training. Tactical Control. Tactical control (TACON) is inherent in OPCON and is the command authority
over assigned or attached forces or commands, or military capability of forces made available for
taskings that are limited to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within
the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks. TACON may be
delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD. Support. Support is a command authority and is established by a superior commander between
subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain
another force. The designation of supporting relationships is important as it conveys priorities to
commanders and staffs who are planning or executing joint operations. The establishing authority
(the common superior commander) is responsible for ensuring that both the supported commander
and supporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander is
granted. The supported commander should ensure that the supporting commanders understand the
assistance required. The supporting commanders will then provide the assistance needed, subject
to a supporting commander’s existing capabilities and other assigned tasks. Administrative Control. Administrative control (ADCON) is direction or exercise of authority
over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support. ADCON is a
Service authority that flows through Service channels. This authority is not an operational
command authority but provides the requisite authority for Services to execute their individual
“organize, train, and equip” functions per Title 10, USC. ADCON may be delegated to and
exercised by commanders of Service forces assigned to a CCDR at any echelon at or below the
<!-- Page 119 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
119
level of Service component command. ADCON is subject to the command authority of CCDRs. Service commanders exercising ADCON will not usurp the authorities assigned by a CCDR
having COCOM over commanders of assigned Service forces. Note: When mobilized under Title
10, USC, command of National Guard and Reserve Forces (except those specifically exempted)
is assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the CCMDs. These forces are available for operational
missions when mobilized for specific periods or when ordered to RegAF after being validated for
employment by their parent Service. 6.8. Joint Force Organization
A joint force is a force composed of elements, assigned, or attached, of two or more Military
Departments operating under a single joint force commander. Joint forces are established at three
levels: unified CCMDs, subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces. These organizations
are commanded by a JFC. Joint Force Commander. A JFC is a term applied to a CCDR, subunified commander, or joint
task force commander authorized to exercise COCOM or operational control over a joint force. JFC’s responsibilities are to provide a clear commander’s intent and timely communication of
specified tasks, together with any required coordinating and reporting requirements. A JFC is
responsible for the transfer of forces and other capabilities to designated subordinate commanders
for accomplishing assigned tasks. A JFC will provide all available information to subordinate
commanders that affect their assigned missions and objectives. Commander, Air Force Forces. The title of commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is
reserved to identify the USAF commander of a USAF component. This component could be
assigned or attached to a joint force at the unified CCMD, subordinate unified CCMD, or joint
task force level. Operationally, the COMAFFOR should be prepared to employ Air Force Forces
as directed by the JFC, and if designated, be prepared to employ joint air forces as the joint force
air component commander (JFACC). The COMAFFOR should normally be designated at a
command level above the operating forces and should not be dual- hatted as commander of one
of the subordinate operating units. This enables the COMAFFOR to focus at the operational level
of war, while subordinate commanders lead their units at the tactical level. Since the COMAFFOR
and JFACC are nearly always the same individual, the USAF prefers to use the term “air
component commander” when referring to duties or functions that could be carried out by either
or both, unless explicit use of the term “COMAFFOR” or “JFACC” is necessary for clarity. This
duality of authorities is expressed in the axiom: Airmen work for Airmen and the senior Airman
works for the JFC. Air Expeditionary Task Force. The air expeditionary task force (AETF) is the primary means by
which the USAF presents forces to a JFC during contingency operations when no existing USAF
component already exists, such as when a joint task force is established. AETFs are sized and
tailored to meet the JFC’s specific mission requirements. When forming an AETF, the
COMAFFOR should draw first from in-theater resources, if available. If augmentation is needed, or if in-theater forces are not available, the USAF will draw from the air expeditionary force
currently on rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater, should be
fully supported with the requisite maintenance, logistical support, health services, and
administrative elements. These forces will form up within the air expeditionary task force as
expeditionary wings, groups, squadrons, flights, detachments, or elements, to provide reasonable
spans of command and control elements at appropriate levels, and to provide unit identity. Air Operations Center. The air operations center (AOC) is the senior agency of the COMAFFOR
that provides command and control of Air Force Forces and coordinates with other components

120
and Services. An AOC may be regional or functional, aligning with the purpose of the joint force
they support. The AOC includes requisite planning, intelligence, employment, mobility, and
assessment capabilities to plan and conduct air operations. If the COMAFFOR is also designated
as the JFACC, the AOC will typically receive joint augmentation and become the joint AOC
(JAOC). Air Force Forces Staff. The COMAFFOR needs a command entity responsible for the
deployment, sustainment, and administration of Air Force Forces. The AFFOR staff is the
mechanism through which the COMAFFOR exercises these Service responsibilities. These
sustainment activities are commonly referred to as “beds, beans, and bullets.” The AFFOR staff is
also responsible for the long-range planning and theater engagement operations that fall outside
the AOC’s current operational focus. Joint Force Air Component Commander. If air assets from more than one Service are present
within a joint force, the JFC normally will designate a JFACC to exploit the full capabilities of
joint air operations. The JFACC is typically the Service component commander with the
preponderance of air capabilities and the ability to plan, task, and control joint air operations. The
JFACC recommends the proper employment of Air Force Forces from multiple components to the
JFC. The JFACC also plans, coordinates, allocates, executes, and assesses air operations to
accomplish assigned operational missions. Because of the wide scope of air operations, the JFACC
will typically maintain the same joint operating area/theater-wide perspective as the JFC. The
JFACC, as with any component commander, should not be dual hatted as the JFC. The
COMAFFOR exercises operational control of Air Force Forces, and acting as a JFACC, normally
exercises tactical control of any Navy, Army, Marine, and coalition air assets made available for
tasking. As such, the term “air component commander” is the preferred term when the commander
is so dual-hatted. If working with partner nations in a multinational operation, the JFACC may be
designated as the combined/coalition force air component commander (CFACC), responsible for
planning, coordinating, and tasking of all multinational air operations. Note: Historic experience
has shown that in joint operations the COMAFFOR is normally designated as the JFACC, as the
USAF typically has the preponderance of air capabilities. In anticipation of this, the Air Force
plans, and trains to employ an air component commander to perform both roles, and the AOC plans
and trains to be a JAOC. <!-- Page 121 -->

### Joint Planning Process
Joint planning consists of planning activities associated with joint military operations by CCDRs
and their subordinate Joint Force Commanders in response to contingencies and crises. Joint
planning is a means of preparing and managing Joint Forces for mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization. At the national level, joint planning
ties the military instrument of national power to the achievement of national security goals and
objectives and is essential to securing strategic end-states across the range of military operations. Planning begins with the end state in mind, providing a unifying purpose around which actions
and resources are focused. Note: Military end state is the set of required conditions that defines
achievement of military objectives. It normally represents a point in time or circumstances beyond
which the U.S. President does not require the military as the primary means to achieve remaining
national objectives. Aside from its obvious association with strategic or operational objectives, clearly defining the military end state promotes unity of effort, facilitates synchronization, helps
clarify, and may reduce risk. Integrated Planning Process. While the focus of joint planning is at the CCDR level, planning
is conducted at every echelon of command and across the range of military operations. Joint
planning employs an integrated process for orderly, analytical, and coordinated problem solving
and decision-making known as the joint planning process. In peacetime, the process is structured
to support the thorough, fully coordinated development of contingency plans. In crisis, the process
can be adapted to support the dynamic requirements of changing events. In wartime, the process
is modified to accommodate greater decentralization of planning activities. Joint Planning Process Steps. The Joint Planning Process is a seven-step orderly, analytical set
of logical steps to frame a problem; examine a mission; develop, analyze, and compare alternative
COAs; select the best COA; and produce a plan or order. The joint planning process consists of
seven steps identified here. Step 1: Planning Initiation. Joint planning begins when an appropriate authority recognizes
potential for military capability to be employed in support of national objectives or in response to
a potential or actual crisis. At the strategic level, that authority—the President, SecDef, or CJCS—
initiates planning by deciding to develop military options. Presidential directives, the National
Security Strategy (NSS), Unified Command Plan (UCP), Contingency Planning Guidance (CPG), National Defense Strategy (NDS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan (JSCP), and related strategic guidance documents serve as the primary guidance to begin
planning. Step 2: Mission Analysis. The CCDR and staff develop a restated mission statement that allows
subordinate and supporting commanders to begin their own estimates and planning efforts for
higher headquarters’ concurrence. The joint force’s mission is the task or set of tasks, together
with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action to be taken and the reason for doing so. Mission
analysis is used to study the assigned tasks and to identify all other tasks necessary to accomplish
the mission. Mission analysis focuses the commander and the staff on the problem at hand and
lays a foundation for effective planning. <!-- Page 122 -->

Step 3: Course of Action Development. A COA is a potential way (solution, method) to
accomplish the assigned mission. Staffs develop multiple COAs to provide commanders with
options to attain the military end state. A good COA accomplishes the mission within the
commander’s guidance, provides flexibility to meet unforeseen events during execution, and
positions the joint force for future operations. It also gives components the maximum latitude for
initiative. All COAs must be suitable, feasible, acceptable, distinguishable, and complete. Step 4: Course of Action Analysis and Wargaming. The COA analysis step closely examines
potential COAs to reveal details that will allow the commander and staff to evaluate them and
identify advantages and disadvantages. Wargaming is a primary means for COA analysis. Wargames are representations of conflict or competition in a synthetic environment, in which
people make decisions and respond to the consequences of those decisions. COA wargaming is a
conscious attempt to visualize the flow of the operation, given joint force strengths and
dispositions, adversary capabilities and possible COAs, and other aspects of the Operating
Environment (OE). Each critical event within a proposed COA should be wargamed based upon
time available using the action, reaction, and counteraction method of friendly and/or opposing
force interaction. Step 5: Course of Action Comparison. COA comparison is both a subjective and objective
process, whereby COAs are considered independently and evaluated/compared against a set of
criteria that are established by the staff and commander. The objective is to identify and
recommend the COA that has the highest probability of accomplishing the mission and is
acceptable. COA comparison facilitates the commander’s decision-making process by balancing
the ends, means, ways, and risk of each COA. The end product of this task is a briefing to the
commander on a COA recommendation and a decision by the commander. Step 6: Course of Action Approval. In the COA approval step, the staff briefs the commander
on the COA comparison and wargaming results and recommends a COA for approval. The
commander may approve the COA, modify it, or direct the staff to reiterate portions of the joint
operation planning process. Step 7: Plan or Order Development. Planning results in a plan that is documented in the format
of a plan or an order. If execution is imminent or in progress, the plan is typically documented in
the format of an order. During plan or order development, the commander, and staff, in
collaboration with subordinate and supporting components and organizations, expand the
approved COA into a detailed plan or operations order (OPORD) by refining the initial concept of
operations (CONOPS) associated with the approved COA. 6.10. Joint Planning
Joint planning is the deliberate process of determining how to implement strategic guidance: how
(the ways) to use military capabilities (the means) in time and space to achieve objectives (the
ends) within an acceptable level of risk. Ideally, planning begins with specified national strategic
objectives and military end states to provide a unifying purpose around which actions and
resources are focused. Leaders conduct joint planning to understand the strategic and operational
environments to determine the best methods for employing the Department of Defense’s
capabilities to achieve national objectives. Joint planning identifies military ways and means the
President can align with other instruments of national power (diplomatic, informational, and
economic). In the process, joint planning frames the problem; aligns ends, ways, and means; develops operational approaches; accounts for risk; and gives leaders decision space with proposed
military options. CCDRs may propose objectives for the President and Secretary of Defense’s
(SecDef’s) consideration before beginning detailed planning. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
<!-- Page 123 -->

123
Staff (CJCS), as the principal military advisor to the President and SecDef, may offer military
advice on the proposed objectives and global prioritization. Campaign Plans. Campaign plans organize the day-to-day operations of the joint force to shape
the OE and achieve national objectives. They establish objectives, conditions, and tasks under
which the united or specified CCMD and Service components build operations, activities, and
investments to achieve objectives (set conditions) in support of national policy. CCMD campaigns
are proactive and rarely feature a single measure of military success implying victory in the
traditional sense. A campaign is a series of related military operations to achieve strategic and
operational objectives in a given time and space. Campaigns are planned when contemplated
objectives exceed the scope of a single operation. Thus, campaigns are often the most extensive
joint operations in terms of time and other resources. CCDRs document the full scope of their
campaigns in plans that include the campaign plan and all of its subordinate and supporting plans. Contingency Plans. Contingency plans are typically prepared in advance to address an anticipated
crisis and must be modified during execution to respond to conditions at the time. A contingency
is a situation that likely would involve military forces in response to natural and man-made
disasters, terrorists, subversives, military operations by foreign powers, or other situations as
directed by the U.S. President or Secretary of Defense. The Joint Planning and Execution
Community uses contingency planning to develop plans for a broad range of contingencies. Commanders and staffs prepare supporting plans that describe how supporting commanders intend
to achieve their assigned objectives and/or tasks. Supporting commanders and staffs develop these
plans responsively in collaboration with the supported commander’s planners. As part of this
collaborative process, supported commanders specify the level of detail required and review and
approve the resulting supporting plans. 6.11. Planning in Crisis
A crisis is an incident or situation that creates a condition of such national security importance that
the President or SecDef may consider a commitment of U.S. military forces and resources to
achieve or defend national objectives. Crises may evolve over time (e.g., escalating civil war, humanitarian crisis) or develop quickly (e.g., hostage rescue, natural disaster) with little or no
warning and require accelerated decision making. Sometimes a single crisis may generate other
crises elsewhere. Multiple crises can also concurrently impact two or more CCDRs. Furthermore, there may be a single threat with transregional implications that simultaneously threatens two or
more CCDRs. In these situations, supported and supporting command relationships may be fluid. Forces and capabilities committed to mitigate emergent threats will likely require dynamic
reallocation or reprioritization. These situations, increasingly the norm, highlight the importance
of integrated planning and making force management decisions from a risk-informed, global
perspective. Planning in response to a crisis generally results in the publication of an order and
the execution of an operation. Crisis planning should help senior leaders determine if a military
response can help achieve the desired objective at acceptable cost and risk levels. Joint Planning and Execution Community. The Joint Planning and Execution Community
(JPEC) monitor, plan, assess, and execute joint operations to ensure the Joint Force Commander’s
seamless transition from planning to execution during times of crisis. This process spans across
organizational levels, including the interaction between Secretary of Defense and CCDRs which
ultimately helps the U.S. President and Secretary of Defense decide when, where, and how to
commit U.S. Armed Forces. Clear strategic guidance and frequent interaction between senior
leaders and planners promote early understanding and agreement for planning assumptions, considerations, risks, and other key factors. <!-- Page 124 -->

### Joint Operation Orders
Important aspects and types of joint operation orders are described here. Warning Order. A warning order (WARNORD), issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, is a planning directive that initiates the development and evaluation of military courses of
action (COAs) by a supported commander and requests that the supported commander submit a
commander’s estimate. Planning Order. A planning order (PLANORD) is a planning directive that provides essential
planning guidance and directs the initiation of plan development before the directing authority
approves a military COA. Alert Order. An alert order (ALERTORD) is a planning directive that provides essential planning
guidance and directs the initiation of plan development after the directing authority approves a
military COA. An ALERTORD does not authorize execution of the approved COA. Prepare to Deploy Order. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by the authority of and at
the direction of the U.S. President or Secretary of Defense, issues a prepare to deploy order to
increase or decrease the deployability posture of units; to deploy or redeploy forces; or to direct
any other action that would signal planned military action or its termination in response to a
particular crisis event or incident. Deployment/Redeployment Order. A deployment or redeployment order is a planning directive
from the Secretary of Defense, issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which
authorizes and directs the transfer of forces between CCMDs by reassignment or attachment. A
deployment or redeployment order normally specifies the authority that the gaining CCDR will
exercise over the transferred forces. Concept of Operations. A concept of operations (CONOPS) is a statement or outline used to
present a commander’s assumptions or intent with regard to an operation or series of operations. CONOPS are designed to give an overall picture of an operation or emerging issue. Execution Order. Only the U.S. President and Secretary of Defense have the authority to approve
and direct the initiation of military operations. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by the
authority of and at the direction of the U.S. President or Secretary of Defense, may subsequently
issue an execute order (EXORD) to initiate military operations. Supported and supporting
commanders and subordinate Joint Force Commanders use an EXORD to implement the approved
CONOPS. Operation Order. An operation order (OPORD) is a directive issued by a commander to
subordinate commanders for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation. Joint OPORDs are prepared under joint procedures in prescribed formats during crisis action
planning. Fragmentary Order. A fragmentary order (FRAGORD) is an abbreviated form of a verbal, written, or digital operation order, which eliminates the need for restating information contained
in a basic operation order while enabling dissemination of changes to previous orders. It is usually
issued as needed or on a day-to-day basis.
