### Managing the Work Environment
Organizational management is the process of organizing, planning, leading, and controlling
resources within an entity with the overall aim of achieving established goals. Organizational
management provides leaders the ability to make decisions and resolve issues effectively for the
benefit of the organization and its employees. While some enlisted members may think of strategic thinking as “above their pay grade,” thinking
strategically is important when establishing goals, and planning how to achieve them, within any
unit or work center. Strategic thinking can be applied at any level, across an entire enterprise or on
a specific project. 13.2. Strategic Thinking
Strategic Thinking refers to thinking on both a large and small scale, long- and short-term to identify
and achieve desired goals. When retired USAF general officers were asked to think of the Airmen they had worked with
during their career who most exceled at Strategic Thinking, they indicated that those Airmen
exceled at: Identifying best and worst-case scenarios for how a situation might be resolved
Considering how other stakeholders would be affected by proposed courses of action
Viewing issues from the perspective of more senior leadership (“work your boss’s problems”)
Identifying a realistic time horizon for achieving goals and building on small successes
(“Thought BIG. Started small. Scaled fast.”)
### Strategic Thinking Mindset
Airmen at all levels should adopt a strategic thinking mindset as they approach issues within their
organization. Strategy sets priorities, goals, objectives, and key performance indicators
(metrics/measures) that are aligned from the lowest echelon to the highest, and ensures all Airmen
are marching down the same Path, toward the same Target. When the current state of performance
is not reaching the target level, continuous improvement methods such as Lean, Six Sigma, or
Theory of Constraints, may be used to address identified issues. Refer to DoDI 5010.42, DoDDWide Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)/Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Program and DoDI 5010.43, Implementation and Management of the DoD-Wide Continuous Process Improvement/Lean Six
Sigma (CPI/LSS) Program, for more on improvement methods to ensure a culture based in
strategic mindsets. The three fundamental components of a strategic thinking mindset are: Intellectual Flexibility. A willingness and proclivity to adjust one’s understanding, opinions, or
approach when conditions change, or new information is presented. Flexibility is about bending, not breaking; we can adapt and adjust without abandoning long-term
strategy and starting from scratch. <!-- Page 247 -->

For example, imagine a request for members of your unit to receive critical training is denied for
budgetary reasons. Rather than ignoring the need for training, or simply continuing attempts to
get approval for the original request, you should consider other options. Perhaps just one of your
Airmen could receive the training and then teach the rest of the unit? Maybe there are other units
nearby whose members have received the training who would be available to teach your Airmen? Intellectual Inclusiveness. Welcoming of information and opinion from a broad range of sources
(individuals, groups, disciplines of study, etc.). A broad, informed perspective often requires many voices to be involved in a discussion, and a
willingness to consider new or seemingly unusual sources of information. Look beyond your immediate organization. Make use of formal and informal networks and reach
out to others with relevant expertise. Maybe you have peers from past assignments who have dealt
with similar issues? Maybe you have contacts within the other Services, or former instructors or
classmates who could share relevant information and expertise. Intellectual Humility. Comfort level with being wrong or having an incomplete understanding, accompanied by the tendency to check oneself, examining issues as if one’s understanding is wrong in
some way. 13.4. Strategic Thinking in Action
In practice, strategic thinking consists of four main activities: scanning, questioning, conceptualizing, and testing: Scanning is the identification of emerging patterns in the environment. This consists of taking in, deconstructing, and synthesizing information from different sources, with the goal of applying this
information to the future. Example scanning techniques could include seeking input from an expert
panel and analyzing historical data to identify trends. Questioning (asking questions of others and oneself) is needed to more fully understand an issue
from different perspectives. This includes framing issues broadly, exploring problems rather than
aiming to solve them immediately, and considering input from all stakeholders. Conceptualizing potential options is needed to identify possibilities for future direction. This
includes identifying a broad range of options (brainstorming), using various analytic tools and
techniques to explore potential solutions, and rejecting options only after exploration. Testing allows for informed speculation to anticipate the impact of a proposed action on
organizational performance. For example, one might initially conduct a role play of how the
proposed course of action would be communicated to stakeholders and how they are likely to
respond. The proposed solution should be tested on a small scale (a pilot test), in order to evaluate
its initial impact and to address any problems that arise in the initial implementation. 13.5. Results Focus
At the individual and team level, optimal performance requires setting goals to stay on track. But
not all goals are alike. Goal setting is most likely to improve performance when goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). S – Specific: Specific objectives/targets should answer who is involved, what is to be
<!-- Page 248 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
248
accomplished, where it is to be done, when it is to be done, which requirements and constraints
exist, and why (purpose) the objective is being accomplished. M – Measurable: Establish criteria for measuring progress toward and attainment of each
objective/target/milestone until the desired objective is met. A – Attainable: Ensure applicable resources are available and objectives/tasks (within acceptable
levels of risk), are possible. It may also be helpful to use action-oriented statements rather than
passive voice. Note: The term “Attainable” does not imply that goals should be easy to attain. Research has consistently found that setting difficult or challenging goals improves performance
more than setting goals that are easy or only moderately difficult to meet. R – Relevant: Link to the mission, vision, and goals and ensure they are meaningful and relevant
to the user. Good objectives must be obtainable, yet purposeful. T – Time-Bound: Provide date for completion. Targeted dates provide periodic and overall
accountability. While goal setting can improve both individual and group performance, interdependent work may
require a focus on how individuals contribute to the group (“group-centric” goals). Goals that are
strictly focused on maximizing individual results (“ego-centric” goals) may backfire when
collaboration is needed. For example, managers may set numeric goals for help desk technicians to resolve a certain number
of help desk tickets each month. “Egocentric” goals for each individual employee to resolve a
certain number of tickets may disincentivize support to other team members, such as training and
coaching new team members. “Group-centric” goals for an entire work unit to resolve a certain
number of tickets may be more likely to increase overall performance, by inherently incentivizing
both processing tickets individually and providing support that will help other team members
resolve tickets as well. <!-- Page 249 -->

### Resource Management
Improving performance requires both planning and execution. For organizational change to be
effective, planning and execution generally must include redesign or coordination on the following
five interrelated fronts. Organization and People. Human resources are the key to future viability and organizational
growth in a continuous learning environment. Although processes and other front factors may
change, focus should remain on providing workers with appropriate knowledge, skills, experiences, and tools. Technology. Technology is a crucial enabling factor that allows compression of cycles, lead time, distance, and broader access to information and knowledge assets. Technology also eliminates
barriers between customers and suppliers. Policies, Legislation, and Regulations. Changing existing policies, regulations, and legislation
may be required for new processes. Physical Infrastructure. Physical facilities, equipment, and tools should be designed to support
and maximize changes in workflow, information technology, and human resources. Process. The flow of work and information into and throughout the organization must be
redesigned using standard continuous process improvement methodologies. Refer to DoDD
5010.42, DoD-Wide Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)/Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Program and
DoDI 5010.43, Implementation and Management of the DoD-Wide Continuous Process
Improvement/Lean Six Sigma (CPI/LSS) Program, for more continuous process improvement
methodologies. 13.7. Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and
Facilities (DOTMLPF)
The acronym, DOTMLPF is used by the Department of Defense to describe a thought process that
considers a broad spectrum of elements or requirements to generate informed, conclusive solutions
to problems, future requirements, strategic direction, and performance improvement. DOTMLPF
is defined as a process that considers solutions involving any combination of these elements. DOTMLPF serves as a valuable mnemonic for staff planners to consider for certain issues prior to
undertaking new efforts. Because combatant commanders define requirements in consultation with
the Office of the Secretary of Defense, they are able to consider gaps in the context of strategic
direction for the U.S. Armed Forces and influence the direction of requirements earlier in the
acquisition process. Here is an example of how DOTMLPF would be interpreted in the military
context: Doctrine: The way we fight (emphasizing maneuver warfare, combined air-ground campaigns). Organization: How we organize the fight (divisions, air wings, task forces). Training: How we prepare to fight tactically (basic military training, advanced individual training, unit training, joint exercises). Materiel: All the ‘stuff’ necessary to equip the forces (weapons, spares) so we can operate
<!-- Page 250 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
250
effectively. Leadership and Education: How we prepare leaders to lead the fight from squad leaders to four
stars (professional development). Personnel: Availability of qualified people for peacetime, wartime, and various
contingency operations. Facilities: Real property, installations, and industrial facilities (government owned ammunition
production facilities) that support the forces. 13.8. Organizational Structure (Balancing Precision with Flexibility)
Organizational design should be determined based on the organization’s overall mission and strategy, taking into consideration the environment, size, and pace of technology. In determining how an organization should be structured, it is important to balance the need for
precision (need to maintain order, decrease ambiguity, and ensure direction is followed) with the
need for flexibility (potential need to adapt quickly and encourage innovation). The pros and cons of various organizational structures are briefly described here. Mechanistic (Bureaucratic) Structure. A mechanistic or bureaucratic organizational structure is
vertically arranged; communication and decision-making begin at the top and then filter downward. In this type of organizational structure, there is very little involvement of low-level members in
decision-making, employees work in teams based on task specialty, and there is a heavy reliance on
rules. The mechanistic system lends itself well to an organization where strategy or goals are geared
toward efficiency and tasks need to be accomplished quickly and accurately. A stable environment
that requires little flexibility is often conducive to a mechanistic structure. Also, if the size of an
organization is intermediate to large, more structure may be necessary. Unfortunately, organizations
with a mechanistic structure may find that job satisfaction suffers because subordinates basically do
as they are told with little to no contribution to how things are done. Organic Structure. An organic organization has horizontal and vertical communication, allowing communication to occur up and down as well as across departments and among coworkers without bureaucratic lines. Cross-talk and opinions are encouraged among employees to
allow more involvement in decision-making and contribution into how things are done. The
flexibility involved in day-to-day operations facilitates technological advancements and allows
employees to be more adaptable as changes arise. The organic organization’s strategy is often
geared toward innovativeness and creativity. The computer software industry is a good example
of one that requires a creative design. The environment is unstable, with change being the norm
rather than the exception. Organizations with organic structure are most often small to moderate, apply new technology through adaptation rather than compliance, and employ research and
development that is creative rather than restrictive. The sharing of information and the
participative environment increases worker satisfaction and often produces well- rounded
decisions. Unfortunately, an organic structure may slow down the implementation process, lead
to low efficiency, and reduce standards. Diverse Structure. Because there are advantages and disadvantages of mechanistic and organic
organizations, organizations with a diverse design incorporate both mechanistic and organic
structures to accomplish the mission. The diverse design is used when the organization needs the
rigid structure of the mechanistic organization in some areas and the flexibility of the organic
organization in others. For example, administrative sections often have specific rules to follow
when processing performance reports, decorations, and orders. For this purpose, a mechanistic
<!-- Page 251 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
251
system would be appropriate. In the same organization, a training section may be hindered by a
rigid mechanistic system; therefore, an organic system would be more effective to allow for more
frequent innovation in how training is delivered. Matrix Structure. The matrix design is basically an organizational design or team within a
mechanistic, organic, or diverse organization. A matrix design is usually best for addressing a
temporary need within an organization; therefore, it is short-lived, and the overall organizational
structure remains intact. A matrix design brings workers from different sections or organizations
together to serve a particular function. Within the matrix design, employees or team members
have two bosses; the functional boss writes their performance report and schedules normal duty
hours, and the project boss or team leader ensures the task at hand is accomplished appropriately. The strength of the matrix design lies in the pooling of expertise and resources; the weakness lies
in the confusion of who is in charge. <!-- Page 252 -->

### Change Management
Change is inevitable. We know changes are taking place every day, all around us. Change is
appropriate when there is a perceived gap between what the norms are and what they should be. Organizational change is not automatic. It is the deliberate adoption of a new idea or behavior by
an organization and the establishment of new norms. These norms can involve technology, tasks, structure, and resources, including people. First, leaders must do their part to create an
organizational climate conducive to change by explaining the limitations or shortfalls of the
present process and the possibilities and benefits of the proposed change. Training to become a
part of necessary change is available to problem solvers and practitioners of continuous process
improvement, which all Airmen should strive to become. Airmen of all skills and jobs should
possess a mindset of critical thinking and problem solving as their first duty. As an Airmen
matures, their career path should include basic, fundamental, intermediate, and Master level
education for change management and continuous process improvement. Next, leaders must
facilitate the change itself by walking Airmen through the change, explaining the details, and
answering questions. Finally, leaders should show appreciation for those who contribute to the
change and help refocus those who do not. Tough-minded, realistic optimism is the best quality a
leader can demonstrate when coping with change. Resistance to Change. The first reaction to change is often perceived as resistance. An essential
element for preventing or overcoming resistance to change is establishing a well thought out plan. Planning enables the change agent (the person advocating for or leading the organizational change)
to build confidence, anticipate questions, develop courses of action, and address opposing
perceptions. Five of the most common responses to change are briefly described here. Distrust. Imposed change that significantly affects an organization will often be met with tough
questions to ensure the change purpose and intent is clearly understood. Leaders who are not
prepared to clarify or explain thought processes behind the change will not easily overcome
employee doubt and will struggle to gain employee buy in. Uncertainty. When faced with impending change, people may experience fear of the unknown
or see the change as a threat to organizational stability and their job security. Employees may
wonder if they will still have a job, if they will be able to do the new job, or if they will have to
learn a new program or process. Self-interest. People often consider the position they currently have or their role in the existing
environment and question the direction and capabilities of those in positions of power after the
change is implemented. Different Perception/No Felt Need to Change. Even if you think people recognize the need for
change, they may see the situation differently, particularly if the change has been dropped on them. Maintain an environment of open communication to build support for the change and reduce the
amount of employees who inwardly resist it. Over-Determination. Ironically, organizational structure may be a barrier to change. For
example, a mechanistic structure that relies on strict procedure and lines of authority may be so
rigid that it inhibits change and possibly damages professional relationships. <!-- Page 253 -->

### Reducing Perceived Resistance to Change
Successful change management depends on addressing causes of resistance and improving the
change implementation process. There are several approaches leaders can take to implement
change successfully. Education and Communication. Open communication is necessary throughout the change
process and helps reduce uncertainty. Educating people about the need for and expected results of
a change should reduce resistance. Participation and Involvement. Leaders reduce resistance by actively involving those affected
in designing and implementing change. Involving people in the change process helps generate
ownership and commitment to the change. Facilitation and Support. Leaders should introduce the change to employees gradually and
provide additional training, if needed. Reinforcement and encouragement help facilitate the power
of high expectations throughout the organization. Negotiation and Agreement. Leaders may choose to offer incentives to those who continue to
resist the change. In difficult times, negotiated agreements can help focus and remind employees
of the changes agreed upon as the change process progresses. Coercion. Coercion is a forcing technique used to make employees accept change. Coercion can
negatively affect attitudes and can potentially cause long-term negative consequences. Coerced
compliance is not recommended and requires constant leadership oversight to ensure the change
remains in effect. 13.11. Three-Stage Change Process
Although there are a wide range of various change processes, the change process model proposed
by renowned social psychologist, Kurt Lewin, recommended leaders view change as a three-stage
process: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing. In the three-stage change process, leaders (change
agents) must analyze restraining or opposing forces and devise ways to reduce them to overcome
resistance. At the same time, leaders must recognize and strengthen supporting forces, which are
those forces pushing toward change. After analyzing the forces for and against change, and
developing a strategy to deal with them, leaders can attend to the change itself. Stage 1: Unfreezing. Once the need for change is recognized, the three-stage change process
begins with unfreezing. Unfreezing is a deliberate management activity to prepare people for
change by knowing and going where issues may exists. The most neglected, yet essential part of
unfreezing is creating an environment where people feel the need for change. A key factor in
unfreezing involves making people knowledgeable about the importance of a change and how it
will affect their jobs or the overall organizational structure. By pointing out problems or challenges
that currently exist in the organization, leaders are able to generate a need in the people who will
feel the greatest effect of the change. Stage 2: Changing. After unfreezing, the next stage in the three-stage change process is changing. The changing stage involves modifying technology, tasks, structure, or distribution of people. During the changing stage, the organization moves from the old state or the previous norms, to the
new state by installing new equipment, restructuring work centers, or implementing procedures. In short, changing is anything that alters the previously accepted status quo. The change agent in
this stage is essential. Change needs to be monitored as it occurs by paying close attention to the people most affected
by the change. Signs of implementing the change too early may include negative reactions from
<!-- Page 254 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
254
employees. In some instances, systems are not completely ready, and production may bog down. Be prepared to receive and respond to feedback in any number of forms to ensure the change
unfolds as successfully as possible. Being involved and available throughout the process will allow
leaders to react quickly to issues as well as provide support to employees who are dealing with the
issues of the change firsthand. Encouragement and involvement in the changing stage may be very
similar to that applied during the unfreezing stage. Note: It is a leader’s responsibility to be
receptive to the needs of the organization and its employees. Readdressing unfreezing techniques
is better than forcing a change that causes more problems than it resolves. Stage 3: Refreezing. The third and final stage in the three-stage change process is refreezing. After implementing a change, it is time to lock in (or refreeze) the desired outcomes and the new
norms so they become permanent. Actively encouraging and reinforcing the use of new techniques
is a way of helping the new behavior stick. A critical step in refreezing is remaining engaged and
evaluating results to determine if the change reached the desired effect or if the new process needs
more support, instruction, training, or time. Positively reinforcing desired outcomes is crucial
during the refreezing stage. Rewarding people when they do something in alignment with the
change emphasizes the value of the new procedures or behaviors and helps freeze them into place. Highlighting successful change helps reduce the desire to return to the old way of doing things. In
many cases, the change agent can call attention to the success of the change and show where it
works while also being receptive to feedback and areas that may cause lingering issues or
continued frustration. In this case, the change agent must evaluate results, reinforce the desired
outcomes, and make constructive modifications, as needed. 13.12. Continuous Improvement
The use of Continuous Improvement (CI) increases operational capabilities while reducing
associated costs by applying proven methodologies to all processes associated with fulfilling the
USAF mission. CI is a comprehensive philosophy of operations built around the concepts that there
are always ways a process can be improved to better meet mission/customer requirements, organizations must constantly strive to make those improvements based on performance metrics
that align to strategic objectives, and efficiencies should be replicated to the extent practical. CI is
a hallmark of highly successful organizations, is an Airmen Leadership Quality, is a both a
commander’s responsibility (AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities), and is a major graded area
in the Air Force Inspection System (AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System), and a focal
point within the Air Force Standards within Air Force Core Values ‘Excellence in all we do’ (AFI
1-1, Air Force Standards). Continuous Improvement Methodologies. USAF CI incorporates aspects of four major
methodologies to assist with organizational change. A practical problem-solving method may
simultaneously draw from more than one of these CI processes. Lean. Lean is a methodology focused on workflow, customer value, and eliminating process
waste. Lean is unique from traditional process improvement strategies in that the primary focus is
on eliminating non-value-added activities. Six Sigma. Six sigma is a rigorous, data-driven methodology for process improvement focused
on minimizing waste through identifying, controlling, and reducing process variation. Business Process Reengineering. Business process reengineering is a comprehensive process
requiring a change in the fundamental way business processes are performed. Business process
reengineering identifies unnecessary activities and eliminates them wherever possible. Business
Process Reengineering allows great opportunity to empower airmen to be innovative Airmen can
strategically align and implement agile, innovative ideas into newly designed processes to give
<!-- Page 255 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
255
the DAF the competitive edge. Theory of Constraints. Theory of constraints is a systematic approach to optimize resource
utilization by identifying, exploiting, subordinating, elevating, and reassessing constraints
(bottlenecks) in the process. 13.13. Practical Problem-Solving Method
At the core of USAF CI is the practical problem-solving method, a standardized and structured
approach to problem solving used by global industry leaders and adopted by DoD. The practical
problem-solving method, as shown in Figure 13.1., is an eight-step process used to clarify
problems, identify root causes, and develop appropriate countermeasures to achieve change. Note: The Osborn-Parnes convergent and divergent thinking techniques described in this handbook’s
chapter on Developing Ideas can be useful during many steps in this process. Figure 13.1. Practical Problem Solving Method
Step 1: Clarify and Validate the Problem. The first step to effective problem-solving is to
clearly understand the problem, often best accomplished by developing a problem statement. A
well-defined problem statement uses data to identify where the problem is occurring, determine
the impact of the problem, and compare performance against a standard with scope and direction. A problem statement does not assume a root cause, solution, or countermeasure, but should include
visual tools to depict the current state. The who, what, when, where, and significance of the
problem statement should be validated by data. This is done by collecting and analyzing data to
validate the existence and magnitude of the problem. If data does not exist, the effort should be
paused to collect and analyze the needed data before moving forward. This step incorporates the
Mess Finding, Data Finding, and Problem Finding aspects of the Osborn-Parnes model. Step 2: Break Down Problem and Identify Performance Gaps. Understanding what
appropriate data is required and the ability to interpret that data is paramount to performance gap
analysis. Step 2 effectively frames and supports the problem in Step 1. Once the problem statement
has been identified and answers the who, what, when, where, and significance of the problem, further analyze the data in comparison to the expected outcome. The expected outcome is the
objective from which to measure the gap between the current state and end state (the expected
outcome) and highlight opportunities for improvements (also called the performance gap). Step 3: Set Improvement Targets. USAF leaders establish a vision of what an organization will
strive to become (the ideal state). In Step 3, process owners or project managers set improvement
targets based on expected outcomes and strategic goals and objectives. Targets help define the
<!-- Page 256 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
256
required performance levels to achieve the desired end state. Targets should be challenging but
achievable. Step 4: Determine Root Cause. USAF leaders often find themselves addressing problems which
have been solved many times when previous problem-solving efforts were directed at symptoms
of a problem rather than root causes. Root cause analysis often involves applying a tradeoff
between digging as deeply as possible as opposed to finding the deepest point within the team’s
sphere of influence. The correct root cause should be validated by using the same data used to
define the problem in Step 1. Step 5: Develop Countermeasures. Step 5 is where potential root causes are addressed with
countermeasures. Consideration should be given to the most practical, efficient, and effective
countermeasures. Valid countermeasures will close performance gaps and should move the
organization closer to the ideal state. When developing countermeasures, strive for process
improvement change that is sustainable and repeatable. At the end of Step 5, obtain a vector check
to ensure strategic alignment with the desired outcome is still moving in the appropriate direction. Remember, the impact of a solution is a combination of the quality of the solution and the
acceptance of the solution by people who implement it. Judiciously involving employees in the
development of countermeasures generates buy-in and ownership of the solution and its success. This step incorporates the Idea Finding, Solution Finding, and Acceptance Finding aspects of the
Osborn-Parnes model. Note: Techniques discussed in this handbook’s chapter on Developing
Ideas can be particularly useful when developing countermeasures. Defer judgment and allow a
period of time to let ideas flow freely (brainstorm potential countermeasures, even those that may
seem odd or unusual) before evaluating and selecting a solution. Step 6: See Countermeasures Through. Step 6 is seeing countermeasures through to execution
and tracking detailed implementation plans for each countermeasure approved in Step 5. Reviews
and progress checks should be updated regularly on all tasks until countermeasures have been
implemented, or until deemed unnecessary. Step 7: Confirm Results and Process. Step 7 compares the results of implemented
countermeasures to the identified performance gaps, improvement objectives/targets, and the
expected outcome. Sustainability and repeatability of the improved process should be verified. Results are measured by data and analyzed to confirm the project’s intent. Processes should be
monitored for performance relative to the baseline developed in Steps 1 and 2, relative to targets
established in Step 3, and relative to the solution implementation. Illustrate confirmed results with
appropriate data tools which link back to performance gaps and improvement targets. Incorrect
root-cause determination is the most common mistake made during CI efforts. If targets are not
met, it may be necessary to return to Step 4. Step 8: Standardize Successful Processes. Step 8 is the most commonly neglected step of the
entire practical problem-solving method; however, it is important to ensure the results of the efforts
made in previous steps are codified. In Step 8, consider the answers to following three questions: What is needed to standardize the improvements? Possible answers may include a submission
to the Airmen Powered by Innovation Program or change requests for technical orders, instructions, manuals, materiel, and suppliers. How should improvements and lessons learned be communicated? The wing process manager
should be made aware of the success. Inputting information into the USAF CI portal, conducting
key meetings, writing publications, utilizing public affairs, informing the chain of command, or
populating data collection sites. <!-- Page 257 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
257
Were other opportunities or problems identified by the problem-solving model? This project
may have identified additional problem-solving opportunities that should be recognized and
addressed. 13.14. Levels of Problem Solving
Consistently applied, the Practical Problem Solving Method provides an excellent tool for making
data-driven decisions with regard to management, process change, and the sharing of best
practices, ensuring actions lead to the desired results with minimal waste. It also ensures the results
are aligned with the needs of the organization. Three different levels of effort are available for
accomplishing this method initiative. As a standardized template for solving problems and
performing process improvement initiatives, the Practical Problem Solving Method is flexible
enough to be effective at any of the following three levels. Just Do It: Also called point improvement, the ‘just do it’ approach involves one person (or a
small team) and can be accomplished in less than a day. Examples could be using torque wrenches
instead of adjustable wrenches or routing paperwork electronically rather than through physical
distribution channels. Rapid Improvement Event: A rapid improvement event consists of a small team of individuals, usually subject matter experts, and can be accomplished in less than a week. It is designed to
develop and implement countermeasures after appropriate project preparations have been made. Examples could be improving aircraft servicing cycle times or improving first-time pass yields on
task management tool taskers. Improvement Project: The ‘improvement project’ setting requires a large team and is conducted
over a longer period of time. Examples could be shortening aircraft annual overhaul cycle time or
writing software to track annual overhauls. 13.15. Project Management
Although there are many definitions of project management, for the purpose of this reading project
management is defined as the process of leading, coordinating, planning, and controlling a diverse
and complex set of processes and people in the pursuit of achieving an established objective. With
this definition in mind, it is important to emphasize that a project is not a program; programs are
ongoing. A project is temporary, based on an established objective that has a generalized time frame
attached to it. Project Management Steps. Project management uses a unique array of terminology to identify
and communicate its principles and uses. Basic terminology is primarily found in the steps of
project management and is explained below. Define the Project Objective. Identify the objective or improvement to be achieved by the
project. What is being satisfied by the project? What is the expected outcome? Develop Solution Options. How many ways might you go about solving the problem? Of the
available alternatives, which do you think will best solve the problem? Plan the Project. Planning is nothing more than answering questions—what must be done, by
whom, how, for how much, when, and so on. Execute the Plan. People sometimes go to great lengths and effort to put together a plan, but
then fail to follow it. Follow your plan. Monitor and Control Progress. The project manager must monitor and control by being
present and making appropriate decisions. This is where to determine whether or not the plan was
<!-- Page 258 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
258
sound and make adjustments. Are we on target? If not, what must be done? Should the plan be
changed/modified? What else have we learned? Close the Project. Once the objective has been achieved, there is still a final step that should
be taken. Document and discuss lessons learned—what went well, what didn't, and what should be
addressed. 13.16. Project Management Constraints
Constraints are numerous for all activities we endeavor, but constraint consideration is crucial for
project management. Quality, time, and cost are among the main constraints most often realized in
project management. Quality. Quality refers to being in accordance with the requirement - the specifications. Time. Time refers to the amount of time you have to complete the project. Cost. Cost refers to your resource constraints, to include money, manpower, machinery, and
materials. One of the constraints (Quality, Time, or Cost) will be your driver for the project. The driving
constraint for your project will have an impact on the other two constraints. Ensure you take this
into consideration when making decisions about the project's objective and adjust the
management of your project accordingly. It is incumbent upon a project manager to provide
leadership and use good team-building techniques to establish a sound project objective and
generate the solution options necessary to achieve those objectives. 13.17. Project Management Planning
Once options are developed, the most important and time-consuming aspect of project management
must occur—planning the project. Planning a project involves activities that answer the questions
who, what, when, where, and how. Techniques of special importance to use during planning are
gathering important information, creating a work breakdown structure, and conducting a task analysis. Regardless of the method of planning used, the completion of the tasks in a sense of order and
timeliness, made foreseeable through the task analysis, ensures project completion is more likely to
succeed. Work Breakdown Structure. A work breakdown structure is a technique based on dividing a
project into sub-units or work packages. Since all the elements required to complete the project
are identified in the work breakdown structure, the chances of neglecting or overlooking an
essential step are minimized. A work breakdown structure is typically constructed with two or
three levels of detail, although more levels are common, depending on the complexity of a project. Such a structure for your project will permit you and others who see the work breakdown structure to
readily identify what needs to be done, spot omissions which might later affect the outcome of the
project and make suggestions for improving and expanding the work breakdown structure. The
amount of breakdown is an element the project manager and the project team must decide upon. Task Analysis. Similar to the work breakdown structure, the amount of detail needed for a task
analysis depends on the task involved and the desires of the project manager and project team. The more
complex the project, the greater the importance of detailed task analysis. Information contained in
the task analysis, which is not depicted in a work breakdown structure, includes task milestones, how the milestones can be measured, and resources or requirements. Project managers may delegate
the task analysis for each task to the appropriate person. Once compiled, final decisions on task
assignments and budgetary concerns can be addressed. The task analysis is what provides the
crucial information for determining how the tasks of the project interrelate. It is imperative to establish

the proper sequencing of tasks prior to beginning a project to ensure the efficiency of the project.
