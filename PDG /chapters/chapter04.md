### Domains of Airpower
Airpower can be applied from within, as well as across the domains of air and cyberspace. From
an operational perspective, the air domain can be described as that region above the earth’s surface
in which aerodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of military operations. The
space domain can be described as that region above the earth’s surface in which astrodynamics
generally govern the planning and conduct of military operations. The cyberspace domain is a
global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of
information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. 4.2. Airpower Defined
For the past 76 years, the USAF has been breaking barriers as a member of the finest joint
warfighting team on the planet, providing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power for
America. In terms of Global Vigilance, Airmen have built a real-time global intelligence and
command and control network that can find, fix, and finish the smallest of targets. Airmen operate
multiple satellite constellations that range from ensuring situational awareness to nuclear warning. Cyber operators build, secure, operate, and defend our critical networks and mission systems, and
are ready to take offensive actions in, from, and through cyberspace. In terms of Global Reach, the USAF ranges the globe rapidly to respond to crises and deliver critical supplies and personnel
to any location on the planet. Mobility Airmen are in 23 countries at 77 locations operating a global
system of airfields and enabling access for allies and joint partners. Persistent engagements by our
highly skilled special operations forces enhance critical relationships and secure global access at
a time and place of our choosing. In terms of Global Power, the USAF can strike an enemy on
short notice anywhere in the world with American fighters, bombers, remotely piloted aircraft, and
intercontinental ballistic missiles. USAF special operators conduct counter-terrorism missions
daily, while our nuclear forces are the ultimate backstop to deter attacks on the homeland and our
Allies and partners who rely on U.S. extended deterrence. As Airmen, we must ensure our mission
is understood at all levels and appreciated for the capabilities airpower brings to the fight. Airpower is the ability to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation
of air and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. As the nation’s
most comprehensive provider of military airpower, the USAF conducts continuous and
concurrent air and cyberspace operations across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of
war. Airpower provides the versatile, wide-ranging means towards achieving national objectives
with the ability to deter and respond immediately to crises anywhere in the world, while aligned
with land and maritime power during operations against enemy forces, and when protecting and
aiding friendly forces. 4.3. Cyberpower Defined
Cyberspace is a global domain within the information environment (IE) consisting of the
interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including
the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and

controllers. This definition of cyberspace comes from Joint Publication (JP) 3-12, Cyberspace
Operations, and AFDP 3-12, Cyberspace Operations. As further described by JP 3-12, cyberspace operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose
to achieve objective in or through cyberspace. Three Components to Cyberspace. Electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum refer to the
wave-particle duality of radiation that, when modulated with information, creates a signal. Data
and networked systems refer to digital information and application programs and the computers
and networks on which they exist. Three components to cyberspace are recognized as: (1) the
“effectors” that encompass a broad range of signal-borne threats, analog and digital; (2) the
“medium” that enables effectors to access the targets, wired and wireless, hardware and software; and (3) the “targets” to include weapons and systems that use computers or networks. Anticipating
and avoiding threats eliminates the need to fight them and saves the concurrent cost to data and
system integrity, making prevention an effective first line of defense against cyber threats. Anticipating a cyber threat includes setting up over-the-horizon early warning systems that detect
anomalous activity, analyzing rapidly its forensic fingerprint to predict future behavior, and
communicating through viable reach-back options to avoid the threat. Four Axioms of Offensive Cyberpower. The four axioms of offensive cyberpower are: misdirecting functionality, stealth access, exploiting vulnerabilities, and superior human cognition. From a war-fighting perspective, the internet has traditionally favored the defense over the offense. This inherent advantage to the attacker resulted from the design of the internet protocols for
tolerance to failure rather than resilience to attack. Modifying the cyber domain may provide an
effective method for attack avoidance. Just as a carrier battle group sails the oceans rather than
sitting still in one location, so can a network or system move around the IP address space for
deception and attack avoidance. The tenets of anti-tamper protection technologies seek to reduce
vulnerability by reducing the scope of protection and focusing on critical components in a system, making them harder to access. This approach allows the defenders to impose high penalties on the
attacker and deter the threat. Hence, offensive cyberpower is the exploitation of the unconceived
vulnerability, where unknown cyber insecurity wins against known cybersecurity in a complex, interactive system of computers, networks, and humans. <!-- Page 76 -->

### Identifying Aircraft
them high
Throughout military history, warriors
have carried their unit colors into battle, raising
to make an
impression on their enemies and giving
unit members a sense of belonging and
pride. That tradition carries on to this
day in the form of aircraft fin flashes or
tail flashes. Information on standard tail
flashes designates the base and unit the
aircraft is from, as well as the tail
number of the aircraft. Traditionally, units would select a single aircraft to be the unit flagship with
a special fin flash that represented the specific squadron or wing and was the assigned airplane for
the unit commander. The flagship was the airplane generally used for photos, air shows, and other
public displays. Today, while tail flash designs, as shown in Figure 4.1., can include color, tail
flashes are often done in various shades of gray to maintain a camouflage appearance. Figure 4.1. Tail Flashes
Aircraft Tail Markings. While similar, each branch of the military has unique aircraft in their
inventory and their codes may vary slightly. Roundel. A roundel is a circular disc often used as a national or historic symbol. One place that
roundels are most commonly seen on are on military aircraft or infrastructure. The French Air
Service originated the use of roundels on military aircraft during World War I, most often using
colors of red, white, and blue as representative of their national flag. Attachment 2, The Roundel, shows the evolution of the roundel throughout its use in the USAF. 4.5. Mission Design Series
The mission design series designator is an official Department of Defense recognized alphanumeric symbol used to designate military defense aerospace vehicles categorized as aircraft, guided missiles, rockets, probes, boosters, and satellites. The designator describes the aerospace
vehicle in two components, separated by a dash. The first component, comprised only of alpha
characters, describes the mission of the vehicle. The second component, comprised of alphanumeric characters, describes the design number and design series of the vehicle. Also, some
designators will have a letter following the two-part designator of the aircraft to indicate the model
type or series, usually due to improved model designs. Over the years, the designations have
changed, but much of the system has remained the same. Table 4.1. is provided to show a
comprehensive list of mission design series designators for USAF aircraft. <!-- Page 77 -->
