### Knowledge is Power
For more than 70 years, Americans have asked Airmen to be the sentinels of air and cyberspace
for the nation, delivering unmatched capabilities and support to the Joint Force in defending our
homeland, owning the high ground, and projecting power with our allies. In every mission, in
every domain, and in every location, Airmen are essential to our nation’s success. America’s
USAF, while transforming into a smaller, leaner, and more capable force, continues to fight the
war on terrorism and prepares to face new threats and conflicts of the future. To remain dominant, we must maintain our airpower advantages over potential adversaries. We must embrace change
and facilitate a culture that embodies courage and innovation. 16.2. Advancing Department of the Air Force Priorities
It is our agile and innovative Airmen and Guardians who power the Department of the Air Force. Everything Airmen and Guardians do should advance or augment DAF priorities. The priorities
will help ensure our Air and Space Force remains lethal and ready when the nation calls: Build the United States Space Force, Modernize the Air and Space Force we need, Grow strong leaders and resilient families, Strengthen our allies and partners. 16.3. Chief of Staff, United States Air Force Professional Reading Program
In 1996, General Fogleman created the Chief of Staff, USAF Professional Reading Program to
develop a common frame of reference among USAF members—officers, enlisted, and civilians—
to help each become better, more effective advocates of airpower. The Chief of Staff, USAF
Professional Reading Program can help launch a career-long reading habit or supplement previous
reading materials. Topics, although the majority detail airpower from its genesis to recent times, include insight into USAF history, analysis of ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future, organizational and leadership success stories, and lessons learned from recent conflicts. These
sources provide great examples of leadership to illustrate qualities Airmen should emulate. The reading list is particularly relevant as civilian men and women take on more responsibility in
these times of global terrorism and international conflict. Each Chief of Staff of the Air Force has
subsequently enhanced and continued the program with current and relevant material for the force. The program currently includes books, films, documentaries, briefings, presentations, publications, journals, and other online resources. The professional reading list and a brief
summary of new selections can be found on the AF Portal (https://www.my.af.mil/) and the CSAF
Leadership Library (https://www.af.mil/About-Us/CSAF-Leadership-Library/). 16.4. Guardian and Airmen Innovation Network
Guardian and Airmen Innovation Network (GAIN) Program is the Department of the Air Force
innovation program that solicits suggestions and ideas from Airmen which contribute to the

### DELETED. 16.6. Mental Frames
Each of us uses mental frameworks and shortcuts to simplify our understanding of a complex
world. The use of frameworks helps us process information quickly and efficiently. Frames consist
of our assumptions about how things are related and how they work. This effect is particularly
noticeable when framing a challenge as either a risk or an opportunity. Research shows that the
human mind naturally estimates the expected return associated with a risky situation. Leaders of
any organization or decision-making team must be careful about imposing mental frames on
themselves and their teams where critical thinking is needed. Prospect Theory. Prospect theory is commonly recognized as the act of framing a situation as a
potential gain that causes decision-makers to act differently than when framing the same situation
as a potential loss. Prospect theory helps explain our tendency to escalate commitment based on
sunk costs instead of making rational evaluations. Based on sunk cost arguments, leaders often
take on more risk, committing additional resources to avoid losses even when the chances of
success are low. Gamblers placing bets even when they are experiencing a losing streak is an
example of prospect theory in that the ‘chances’ of winning seem greater with each chance taken. Change. Another implication of framing is how organizations react when faced with changes in
the operating environment or mission tasking. At the organizational level, threats to our
comfortable framework of assumptions are often met with rigid resistance, while changes we see
as opportunities are met with flexibility and adaptability. As human beings, Airmen are subject to
the initial frameworks we establish when confronting change. For good or bad, these frameworks
act to limit the information we take in, our willingness to fairly and unbiasedly assess information, and ultimately restrict the solution sets we create. Consciously avoid an inherent tendency to view
change as threatening. Intentionally framing change as an opportunity may allow others to freely
exercise the habits of mind necessary to make well informed decisions. Analogies. Analogies are often powerful decision-making tools. Great innovative breakthroughs
can sometimes occur when analogies from one field or domain are applied to another. Reasoning
by analogy occurs when we assess a situation and match it to similar experiences we have
previously encountered. At the conscious level, analogies can be used to save time and provide
clues about courses of action and implications for a decision-making process. However, without
deliberate consideration, analogies may lead us to focus on similarities between events and
downplay important differences. When allowing analogy in decision-making, effort should be
made to clearly separate fact from assumption. The act of questioning assumptions in any decisionmaking process is, at its heart, how we apply the habits of mind necessary for good critical thought. Intuition. Intuition can complement a decision-maker when used in conjunction with the
evaluation of a whole series of alternatives and not solely based on objective analysis. A strength
of using intuition is that it is based on matching patterns from previous experiences to cues picked
up in the current environment. Based on recognition of patterns, decision-makers may select a
course of action as if reading a script instead of truly exploring options. Having decided on an
initial preferred course of action, senior leaders often mentally play out a solution, and if it seems
feasible, they go with it. Note: Proper use of combined intuitive judgment along with formal
<!-- Page 307 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
307
analysis may be an effective decision-making technique. Formal analysis can check intuition, while intuition is useful in validating and testing assumptions that underlie analysis. As Airmen, recognizing the value of intuition is just as critical as guarding against a lack of analysis in the
decision-making process. 16.7. Critical Thinking in Groups
Conventional wisdom holds that groups make better decisions than individuals because they draw
from a base of talent and experience. However, Airmen must be conscious of how group decisions
are made and create teams capable of applying critical thought to problems in group settings. Airmen engaged in group decision-making must consciously structure the process to encourage
critical thinking to prevent momentum from simply leading the group toward conformity. There
are a few things to consider when using groups for decision-making. Who should be involved in the decision process? In what sort of environment should the decision take place? How will the participants communicate? How will the leader control the decision process? Wisdom of Groups. While keeping in mind that groupthink does exist, consider establishing
groups for decision-making, made up of members that represent many different disciplines and
areas of expertise. Have the group discussions in a decentralized location, be able to effectively
aggregate all the individual judgments, and seek group members who are independent, meaning
not subordinate to one another. Hindrances to Groups. Behaviors that are contradictory to working in groups, such as
withholding information for personal reasons or filtering information should not be tolerated. Another behavior that should not be allowed is selectively presenting information up the chain of
command to inadvertently affect the group’s efforts. In addition to this, leaders who are in
positions to make decisions based on the recommendations of a group should be aware of how
the group was set-up and how well it operated to have an understanding of what the decision was, as well as the dynamics of how the decision was made. Decision-Making Teams. When creating or observing qualities of good teams, look for
individuals who are able to sway others in the crowd. Seek out and encourage individuals who are
able to contribute and speak up when in a group dynamic. Group members who demonstrate
independence and the ability to overcome hierarchical stigmas will often prove to be strong team
members. Another quality for group members is one that encourages honest, candid analysis and
contributions from others, even when not in complete alignment with their own. The most
successful groups will consist of a good balance of individuals who do not dominate discussions, but also do not constantly remain in the background. 16.8. Groupthink
Groupthink is a common decision trap and one of the major causes of flawed decision-making in
groups. Groupthink occurs when tremendous pressures within the team demand conformity and
express a strong desire for unanimity at the expense of true critical thinking. Causes of groupthink
can stem from strong personalities or influences that overpower or hinder others from being equal
contributors to the group, or they can stem from individuals choosing not to speak up in a group
so they may be allowed to participate without taking risks or exposing themselves to adverse
opinions from others in the group. Whatever the reason for groupthink, it puts the entire group at
a disadvantage and should be addressed quickly to get the group back on track toward achieving
<!-- Page 308 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
308
its purpose for convening. Symptoms of Groupthink. To prevent groupthink, Airmen must be aware of the symptoms. Common indicators of groupthink include: the group demonstrating a feeling of being invulnerable
or egocentric, there is a tendency to rationalize away disconfirming data and warning signs of
ineffective judgment or critical thinking, the group concludes topics with a feeling of unanimity
regarding particular views, individuals are pressured when they present dissenting views, and
group members regress in their desire or ability to contribute to the group. Reducing Groupthink. If groupthink is present, outside consultation may be required to get the
group on the right track. In other cases, Airmen can work to minimize structural barriers to candid
dialogue and reduce groupthink tendencies within their organization. Some ways to reduce
groupthink include: defining roles within decision-making teams by giving responsibility to
members for aspects of the analysis process and holding them accountable for representing these
perspectives within the group and inviting healthy disagreement during the analysis process to
encourage candid dialogue. 16.9. Influence of Dissenting Airmen
What should you do if you are part of a group, and you are concerned the group will make a bad
decision? It may seem obvious, but it is important that you speak up during the group’s
discussions. Groups tend to make better decisions when exposed to an opposing view because group members
become more likely to see the situation from different angles. When making yes/no decisions (e.g., guilty/not-guilty verdict on a jury), groups typically make
decisions that the majority of group members would have recommended if asked independently
and anonymously. For example, 85% of the time the majority position on a jury’s first ballot will
end up being the group’s final decision. However, in most decision-making contexts, there are many possible alternatives, and even a
single opposing view can encourage groups to consider a broader range of possible options. For
example, imagine only two civilian candidates applied for a job. The question posed to the group
may have originally been framed as “Should we hire Candidate A or Candidate B?” While it may
seem like there are only two options (you support Candidate B, while others support Candidate
A), there are probably other alternatives. For example, could the position be re-advertised to
encourage more people to apply? Could one of the candidates be detailed to the position so the
group can re-evaluate based on initial performance before making a final decision? Could the
position be filled by a military member rather than a civilian? Even a single opposing view can foster divergent thinking (generation of a range of possible
alternatives). So even if a group does not ultimately adopt your specific position (i.e., hire
Candidate B), group members will be more likely to think of other possible alternatives that they
may not have otherwise considered or shared. As a result, good group decisions become more
likely. 16.10. Critical Judgment
Professor Andrew J. DuBrin, Doctor of Industrial/Organizational Psychology, stated that a high
performance team demands sincere and tactful criticism among members. In the USAF, it is
imperative that feedback is welcomed and encouraged among team members, as well as from a
broad spectrum of sources. Receiving information is a way of giving consideration to new, different, and often better ways of performing. The willingness to accept and show appreciation
<!-- Page 309 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
309
for constructive criticism increases self-awareness and improves team effectiveness. By
encouraging and considering critical feedback, teams can redirect focus and energy to correct
problems quickly rather than allowing them to intensify. For feedback or criticism to be
productive, the collective purpose for the feedback must be for all parties involved to ultimately
have the same expected outcome – to improve a process or procedure that positively contributes
to the mission. Note: Honesty is important; however, brutal honesty can be offensive. Giving
constructive criticism requires a focus on fixing or improving upon a problem, not focusing on
problems for personal or oppositional gain. 16.11. Addressing Conflict Positively
Disagreement between participants in any decision-making process is necessary to stimulate
inquiry and analysis. The challenge for leaders is to create constructive conflict while retaining the
teamwork and relationships necessary for future decision events. In the decision-making process, debate focused on the issues and ideas at hand (cognitive conflict) is constructive. On the other
hand, emotional and personal outbursts (affective conflict) are not. A key aspect of managing the
decision process is to stimulate cognitive conflict to advocate positions and analysis—debating
concepts, but not attacking the person representing them. Airmen in leadership positions should
clearly establish ground rules for interaction during deliberations and require participants to
respect each other’s cognitive and analytical styles. 16.12. Indecision
Indecision is not solely a problem with leaders, organizational cultures, or complex topics. Indecision often occurs as a result of combinations of all three. The aspect of organizational
cultures can be addressed by recognizing patterns of behavior that manifest dysfunction within the
decision-making process. Three harmful organizational cultures are briefly described here. The Culture of No. Organizations with a culture of no have established a decision-making process
where lone dissenters are able to issue non-concurs within the planning process, effectively
blocking overall organizational goals because they conflict with internal sub-organizational
interests. This culture can arise in organizations where meetings focus on dissections of proposals
instead of true debate and analysis. Leaders who reward subordinates based on their ability to
dissect other’s ideas without providing alternative courses of action enable and promote a culture
of no. In a culture of no, dissenters tear down or block proposals and ideas rather than critique a
proposal with the intent of strengthening it. The Culture of Yes. Organizations with a culture of yes have established an environment where
dissenters tend to stay silent. This silence becomes a tacit endorsement of the proposal without the
benefit of analysis and debate. In this form of organizational culture, once a decision is made, subordinates later express disagreement to distance themselves from a decision or to undermine
the implementation of the plan. Airmen operating in this type of culture must understand that
silence does not mean assent and watch for those not contributing to the discussion. Overcoming
this cultural tendency requires leaders to bring constructive conflict within the decision process to
the surface and analyze concerns and alternative interpretations of evidence. The Culture of Maybe. Under the culture of maybe, decision-makers work to gather as much
information as possible, which often results in ‘analysis paralysis.’ Under analysis paralysis, decision-makers constantly delay action because they think more information and analysis will
clarify their choice. This culture tends to develop in organizations facing highly ambiguous
situations or in organizations where competing sections/leaders practice conflict avoidance as
opposed to open analysis and debate. In these organizations, decision-makers must balance the
benefit of gaining more information against the diminishing returns they provide, as opposed to
<!-- Page 310 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
310
initiating action. While leaders are seldom able to accurately calculate the cost versus benefit of
waiting for additional clarity, intuitive judgment serves as a cut-off for unnecessary delay. 16.13. Decision-Making Outcomes
Procedural Justice. The process by which a decision is made significantly influences
implementation and follow-through of the solution. The key aspect to the outcome of a critical
decision is consensus among the team responsible for enactment. In many cases, consensus does
not mean unanimity; consensus is a commitment to, and shared understanding of, the desired
outcome. Procedural Fairness. Airmen must work to make sure a decision process is fair and legitimate. Even when participants agree with the chosen course of action, if they do not see the process as
legitimate, they are often disenchanted with the outcome. Procedural fairness provides support to
decision-makers, especially when they are making unpopular decisions. Fair processes help build
consensus, but more importantly, aid in implementation because participants feel that all
perspectives have been considered and analyzed. If decision-makers are subjective in their
analysis, participants lose faith in the decision process, making it difficult to support the outcome. Providing participants with time and venues to express their positions and a transparent system of
weighing different perspectives is important. When final decisions are made, the fairness of the
process is what allows Airmen to rally around the designated way ahead with confidence that the
decision-maker considered all aspects before finalizing which course of action to pursue. Note: From an application standpoint, some leaders seek consensus as a means of empowering their
people; however, the adage that “a camel is a horse built by consensus” is not so farfetched. Great
leaders do not seek consensus—they build it. Procedural Legitimacy. Procedural legitimacy in decision-making occurs when the decision
process is perceived to be in line with an organization’s socially accepted norms and desired
behaviors. To create an organizational culture of decision legitimacy, leaders should provide a
process roadmap at the beginning of the decision process, reinforce, and demonstrate an open
mindset, engage in, and encourage active listening, separate advocacy from analysis, explain the
decision rationale once made, express appreciation for everyone’s participation, and express how
alternative inputs contributed to the process. 16.14. Accidents, Deviance, and Consequences
Within the USAF, like any other organization, decisions made in highly complex, tightly
integrated environments may have unanticipated consequences. If Airmen are unaware of, or have
failed to think through decisions, catastrophic failure can result. With the understanding of the role
all Airmen play in using the habits of mind for critical thinking, the following sections examine
perspectives on decision-making failure. Normal Accident Theory – Structural Perspective. The normal accident theory rests upon the
assumption that in any highly complex high-risk organizational structure, decision failures are
unavoidable. High-risk systems are systems classified by their complexity and the coupling of
multiple processes occurring in conjunction with one another. Systems that are interactively
complex and tightly coupled are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic failure stemming from
mistakes made by decision-makers, often small mistakes, which go unrecognized or uncorrected. In coupled (interdependent) systems, tight interactions based on poor decisions can magnify
normal accidents into system-wide failure. In simple linear processes, such as an assembly line, failure has a visible impact on the next process, but is identifiable and limited. When interactions
are nonlinear and affect a variety of other systems, the failure of one component has unanticipated
<!-- Page 311 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
311
effects on many subsystems. If the subsystems are tightly coupled (highly interdependent) a failure
quickly causes changes in multiple systems nearly simultaneously, making it hard for leaders to
diagnose the symptoms and determine the extent of the failure. Because Airmen project power
globally, anticipation of the impact from even minor deviations from procedure or instruction, is
extremely challenging. Normalized Deviance Theory – Behavioral Perspective. The normalized deviance theory is the
gradual acceptance of unexpected events and risks as a normal behavior in the operating
environment, including the acceptance of lower standards. This practice of producing shortcuts or
variations to normal procedures eventually becomes normalized to the point where the deviance is
no longer noticed. Deviations become accepted as new norms and are no longer assessed using the
habits of mind necessary to identify causes and find solutions. As organizational members become
accustomed to the reoccurrence of seemingly minor but unpredicted anomalies, they become less
concerned with the potential catastrophic effects of more severe failures of the same system. A classic case of normalized deviance is the example of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. In
this case, the erosion of O-rings was not within acceptable tolerances. However, after its
occurrence, several times with no catastrophic result, the members of the organization accepted
their erosion as a normal and acceptable event, despite deviation from their engineering standards. In this case National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as an organization, was working hard
to make space flight feel routine. The organization’s culture, combined with cognitive bias and
external pressures, led to the normalization of a potentially catastrophic failure. Airmen must be aware of the type of organization they operate within and understand its complex
interactions. We should guard against substandard procedures by continuously questioning the
way we do business, consciously identifying the “close-calls” and deviances from normal
operations and ensuring deviations from standards are analyzed as part of the decision-making
process to gain an understanding of how to improve programs and implement new decisions. Practical Drift. Within large organizations, sub-unit leaders at all levels make decisions to
maximize efficiency. They establish localized rules and procedures that comply with the overall
intent of the organization. Over time, these procedures become accepted practice. Similar to
normalizing deviance, this practice causes organizational norms to drift. Often, this drift is
unproblematic; however, under ambiguous conditions in complex interactive environments, divergence may lead to altered expectations and poor information flow (resulting in catastrophic
cross-system failure). Airmen must be aware of how their decisions at the local level tie in with overall organizational
goals, standards, and expectations. Leaders must use their awareness of organizational goals and
standards to monitor practical drift in their areas of responsibility, recognize disciplined initiative, and maintain standards consistent with outside expectations. Airmen in positions of responsibility
must work to temper practical drift and create a culture where critical thinking is applied to
ambiguous threats. This goal can be accomplished by developing processes for identifying and
analyzing small problems and failures and treating them as potential indicators of larger problems. Effective techniques include empowerment of front-line workers and flattening hierarchies to
reduce information filtering. Leaders can further minimize the problems associated with practical
drift, by: Creating and encouraging transparency in organizational structures and systems to identify
local practical drift and understanding the “why” behind local standards. Avoiding ‘Band-Aid®’ approaches to small problems by fixing the root cause across the
system, as well as creating a climate of candid dialogue to review and revisit standards and seek
<!-- Page 312 -->

312
problems. Monitoring seams where information is handed off between units and organizations. Conducting careful after-action reviews focused on process improvement. Ambiguity. The challenge for Airmen of all ranks is that ambiguous threats do not trigger
organizational responses. The failure to apply critical thinking to ambiguous threats means the
recovery window between the emergence of the threat and its occurrence as a catastrophic failure
may narrow. Airmen at all levels must be aware that ambiguous threats may go unaddressed due
to information filters caused by structural complexity and inter-organizational power dynamics. <!-- Page 313 -->

### Learning is Power
Effective Airmanship requires good decision-making. From Airman Basic to General, the
decisions each of us make every day impact the delivery of airpower. The habits of mind necessary
for becoming a critical thinker are developed over time. Each of us must work every day to make
good decisions by consciously applying the intellectual analysis necessary to account for
complexities. The process of decision-making is as important as the information analyzed. The
habitual application of critical thinking methods to the gathering and analysis of information helps
reduce our unconscious and natural tendency to accept an available option as satisfactory without
actually exploring all feasible options before making a decision. 16.16. Digital Literacy (Information Literacy)
Decision makers must be informed and capable of distinguishing information relevant to the
decision at hand. Fortunately, the internet has made more information available than ever before. This allows for
immediate access to information from a wide variety of sources and provides the potential for
real-time updates as conditions change. However, because internet information is not regulated for
quality and accuracy, it is particularly important to critically evaluate sources and consider the
potential for inaccuracy or misinformation. To become a critical consumer and internet user, a common best practice is to apply the “CRAAP
test,” which is a list of questions to evaluate potential information. The CRAAP acronym stands
for Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose: Currency (timeliness): When was the information published or last updated? Have newer articles
been published on the topic? Does your topic require recent information, or will older sources work
as well? Relevance (importance of the information for your needs): Does the information answer your
question? Who is the intended audience? Is the information at an appropriate level (i.e., not too
simple, or overly technical for your needs)? Authority (source of the information): Who is the publisher or sponsor? What are the author’s
credentials or organizational affiliations? Is the author qualified to write on the topic? Accuracy (reliability, truthfulness, and correctness of content): Is the information supported by
evidence? Was the information reviewed by editors or subject experts before it was published? Can you verify any of the information in other sources? Purpose (the reason the information exists): Is the information intended to inform or teach? Or is
it intended to sell, entertain, or persuade? Does the point of view appear objective and impartial? Are there political, ideological, cultural, religious, institutional, or personal biases? In general, aim to rely on sources that have strong incentives to present accurate information. There
may be little consequence to the writer of a blog or message board post if they get facts wrong. For-profit companies may purposely mislead in order to present their company and products
positively. However, information in newspaper articles or scientific papers is normally reliable; errors in these forums can seriously damage the author’s reputation. <!-- Page 314 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
314
### Analytical Thinking
Informed decision making requires more than gathering and evaluating facts. It requires analytical
thinking to systematically break information apart, compare different aspects of a problem, and
organize information to address complex, multidimensional issues. As a first step, exercise healthy skepticism and consider several potential causes of what you
observe. One can often avoid errors in analytical reasoning by recognizing a few basic principles: Limitations of Small Sample Sizes. Judgments based on a large number of observations (large
number of people, events, etc.) are more likely to be accurate than judgments based on a small
number of observations. Example: Imagine you decided to get a college degree as part of your personal growth. You have
a program in mind, but there are so many educational institutions to choose from. You have
narrowed your choice to University A or University B. You have several friends that attend each
school. Your friends at University A all really like the school; your friends at University B are
very dissatisfied with their school. However, when you visit University B you have a good
experience and like the students and professor that you met with. In contrast, during your visit to
University A, you get the brush-off from the professor you tried to speak with and didn’t “click”
with the students you met. Which school should you attend? Many people will say you should attend University B because
you personally had a positive experience (“go with your gut”). While that’s not necessarily wrong, it is important to fully recognize the limited duration of your visit (How much of the school did
you see? How many different classes did you sit in on? How many students, professors, etc. did
you interact with?). In comparison, your friends at University B will have had much more
extensive opportunities to interact with many others at the school over a longer time period. Take the time to base your decisions on a larger number of observations when possible. Impressions based on a few days, or a few people will usually not be as accurate as judgments or
data based on a larger number of observations. Correlation Doesn’t Imply Causality. It is important to consider how different factors are
interrelated, and whether changing (increasing or decreasing) one factor may impact others. Even
when two factors are clearly related, do not immediately assume that one factor is causing the
other. To make firm conclusions, ensure that you are making fair comparisons. While the real world does
not lend itself to carefully designed double-blind randomized clinical trials (the “gold standard”
for scientific research), it is important to apply the concept of the control group when making
judgments. Before scientists determine that a pill causes a certain health outcome, they compare
outcomes for those who have taken the pill to outcomes for those who have not. Before concluding
that the pill caused the difference in outcomes, they ask an important question: Are the two groups
otherwise (mostly) the same? For example, imagine that a base offered XYZ supplements for free to all RegAF members. Members who took the free supplements improved their physical fitness test scores after taking
the supplements, while there was no change in the physical fitness test scores of others. Before you conclude that XYZ supplements cause improved physical fitness, ask some questions. Consider whether the people who took XYZ supplements differed in important ways from those
who didn’t. Maybe there was a self-selection bias: members who exercised more or ate healthier
foods (i.e., were more motivated to improve their fitness) were more likely to choose to take
Vitamin XYZ. Or maybe Vitamin XYZ takers were younger than non-takers, or less likely than
<!-- Page 315 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
315
non-takers to have pre-existing health conditions. The more similar the two groups, the more reasonable it would be to conclude that XYZ
supplements cause improved physical fitness. Deciding to take XYZ supplements may or may not
be a good idea. Before you make that decision though, consider whether you’re making a fair
comparison. 16.18. Creative Thinking and Creative Problem Solving
Creative problem solving involves two distinct components: Divergent Thinking and
Convergent Thinking. Divergent Thinking is defined as the ability to generate multiple varied
solutions to a given problem. Brainstorming is a divergent thinking task. Convergent Thinking, in
contrast, is a process that seeks out the correct or best possible solution (from identified
possibilities). With formal education and training, we tend to improve in Convergent Thinking skills, but we
tend not to improve (may even worsen) on Divergent Thinking. Yet both processes are important
for effective problem solving. The Osborn-Parnes model is one recommended problem solving approach that incorporates
Divergent and Convergent Thinking. Central to this approach is the principle of deferred
judgment. This principle requires that we allow a period of time to let ideas flow freely (apply
Divergent Thinking) without internal or external evaluation. Only after we have identified many
possible ideas, should we evaluate them (apply Convergent Thinking). The model consists of the following stages: each stage involves successive Divergent and
Convergent Thinking tasks (in each stage, letting ideas flow freely before applying judgment): 1. Mess Finding. Identify the problem that you want to address. What do you want to change? Summarize the problem as a “How to…” statement (e.g., “How to reduce the number of
Airmen calling in sick”)
## Data Finding. Seek out all relevant facts that apply to the situation. Ask the five Ws: Who is involved? What is involved? What are some examples of the problem? When does it or will it happen? Where does it or will it happen? Why does it happen? Then try to identify what additional facts about the situation are lacking and where you might
search for them. Get the facts. 3. Problem Finding. Describe what you want to accomplish in more specific terms. Ask yourself: “In What Ways Might We…” (IWWMW) address the situation. Brainstorm
many problem statements. What you initially thought you wanted to accomplish might reflect
another concern, desire, or need. After reflection, select the problem statement(s) that captures the most important or underlying
problem (e.g., “Decrease the spread of COVID-19 in the squadron”). <!-- Page 316 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
316
## Idea Finding. Identify as many potential solutions to the problem as possible. Thinking of many ideas (even far-out, odd, or unusual ideas) is critical. Write all the ideas
down. It is often helpful to set a numeric goal (e.g., 50-75 ideas) before you discuss or review
the ideas. If time permits, incubate (sleep on it, let your mind wander) to generate additional ideas. Positive mood and rest facilitate brainstorming. In a group setting, it can sometimes help to have members offer ideas anonymously. Extrinsic
motivations (e.g., to impress others with great ideas) can undermine divergent thinking. Anonymity may help group members feel safe to put forward ideas that go beyond the triedand-true. Only after you have allowed time to generate many ideas should you begin to evaluate them
and narrow the list (e.g., to select 6-8 ideas that seem to have the greatest potential). 5. Solution Finding. Use a list of selected criteria to choose the best solution. First create a preliminary list of criteria that should be used to evaluate your ideas (e.g., time, cost, feasibility, safety, impact on morale)
Identify which criteria are most critical and assign a weight to the importance of each criteria
(e.g., using a 1-10 scale, where 10 is most important). Then use a decision matrix, Table 16.1, to rate each idea (each potential solution) on each of the criteria: Criteria 1 Criteria 2
Criteria 3
Idea 1
Idea 2
Idea 3
Table 16.1. Decision Matrix Example
Multiply the ratings by the weight assigned to each of the criteria. Idea(s) that are evaluated most
favorably on the highest weighted criteria should be the preferred solution(s). 6. Acceptance Finding. Attempt to gain acceptance for the solution, develop a plan of action, and implement the solution (follow through). 16.19. Decision-Making Model
There are a wide range of decision-making models available for leaders, whether in the military or
corporate structure. One decision-making model that has been adopted by the military is the
Vroom-Yetton-Jago Decision-Making Model, used for deciding how to decide. According to this
model, there are five primary levels of decision-making, each requiring a different level of
involvement or complexity for the decision-making process. The following is a brief description
of each of the five levels of decision-making and some pros and cons associated with each level. Level I: Decide and Announce. In this level, leaders make the decision and announce or present
it to the group or organization. This approach can allow leaders to make and implement decisions
quickly, but to avoid possible indifference or lack of motivation. In this approach, the leader
controls the decision and the situation. Leaders should explain rationale as to why the decision was
made unilaterally. Cons associated with this approach are that leaders may not take the time to
consider all the necessary information. By not including others in the decision-making process, leaders may alienate members of the group or organization unnecessarily. Level II: Gather Input from Individuals and Decide. In this level, leaders gather input from

selected individuals, or the group individually and then make the decision. This approach can allow
leaders to consult with recognized experts to gather additional information to make a more
informed decision but does not require a meeting with the entire group. Cons associated with this
approach are that others in the group may wonder why the leader did not consult with them. They
may perceive the leader as playing favorites, which could result in some resistance from the group
or organization when it comes time to implement the decision. Level III: Gather Input from the Group and Decide. In this level, leaders gather input from the
group and then make a decision. This approach of including the group in gathering the data
enhances the chance for synergy and better-informed decision-making. Cons associated with this
approach are that if a leader makes a decision different from what the group suggests, the group
may feel that their inputs or suggestions were not valued or appreciated. The group may feel that
the decision-making process was predetermined by the leader and that the interaction was a façade, which will likely result in members of the group undermining implementation or being unwilling
to participate in future decisions. Also, this approach does take more time for the leader to make
the decision. Level IV: Facilitate Consensus. In this level, leaders present issues or problems to the group and
facilitate the decision-making process within the group. If the group is unable to reach consensus, the leader has the option to make the decision. This approach of allowing the group to generate
possible decision options enhances buy-in and ownership of members of the group, educates
members of the group, and allows for quicker implementation as more people are knowledgeable
about the decision process and what needs to be done. This approach helps build and sustain trust
and respect between group members. Cons associated with this approach are that it takes more
time. Also, there is the possibility that the decision could be one that is adequate, but not optimal
due to the nature of groups arriving at a compromise to reach an agreement and the leader needing
to accept the decision or facilitate further decision analysis. Level V: Delegate with Constraints. In this level, leaders delegate the problem to the group and
authorize the group to make the decision within specified boundaries. Leaders do not abandon the
group but facilitate support and resources to enable the group’s success in making a decision. This approach is good for building team leadership skills and allows ownership of the decision
by the group. It also frees the leader to focus on other issues. Cons associated with this approach
are that it takes more time, it may lead to a decision not viewed by the leader as optimal, and the
team may not have the skills to reach a quality decision, resulting in disharmony among the group
rather than pride in ownership over the decision. Note that the Osborn-Parnes process can be
applied regardless of who provides input or makes the final decision. For example, leaders can
apply the Osborn-Parnes process to reach a decision independently (Level I: Decide and
Announce). They can involve others in Idea Finding only (Level I or II: Gather Input and Decide). Or they can encourage others to apply the Osborn-Parnes process (Level IV or V: Facilitate
Consensus or Delegate with Constraints). <!-- Page 318 -->

### Expansion
Innovation, technological edge, advanced skills training, future capabilities… How do we ensure
we are prepared for the future? Clarifying what we do know and what we don’t know is one place
to start. Here are a few statements that emphasize our need to stay on the cutting edge. Fifth-generation aircraft are critical to penetrate adversaries’ existing air defenses, but other
nations continue to invest in advanced air defense systems. Adversaries are fast followers of American technology, constantly narrowing the gap and
looking for ways to surpass or defeat American innovation. Even adversaries who can’t compete with American airpower in the sky challenge our air
superiority by using ground-based systems and technology. Maintaining air superiority into the future requires consistent investment in technology and
research today. As adversary technology narrows the gap, highly trained American Airmen provide the
advantage. Training against rigorous and realistic threats is vital to prepare Airmen to react within seconds
during real world operations. The lack of budget stability and predictability makes it difficult for the USAF to modernize
training technology and facilities and ensure our pilots maintain an edge over adversaries. 16.21. Empowerment
Today’s leader has the almost impossible task of keeping up with ever-changing technology. Today’s junior members have knowledge, skills, and abilities that open unlimited opportunities to
maximize work center effectiveness. Leaders must encourage Airmen to develop their capabilities
and foster their willingness to improve organizational effectiveness. Empowered followership, like
motivation, requires a joint effort between leaders and the individuals they lead. This effort must
be continuously promoted. The mission is best served when the leader helps followers develop
their own initiatives, encourages them to use their own judgment, and allows them to grow. As a
result of promoting empowered followership, creativity and innovativeness improve dramatically. Empowerment is a force that energizes people and provides responsibility, ownership, and control
over the work they perform. Delegation is not empowerment; however, effective empowerment
does require good delegation. Assigning tasks and allowing the freedom and authority to creatively
accomplish those tasks is the essence of empowerment. Empowerment allows workers to become
stakeholders in the organization’s vision. Once committed to the vision, members participate in
shaping and fashioning a shared vision. This synergistically developed vision motivates people to
focus on what the future holds, not simply because they must, but because they want to. The military is traditionally an authoritarian organization. The need for rapid decision-making and
crisis response normally necessitates a traditional hierarchical framework; however, complex
hierarchical frameworks do not always result in rapid decisions. Furthermore, the continual
transformation of leader-follower roles is heralding an environment that allows both leaders and
followers to more effectively realize organizational goals and objectives. <!-- Page 319 -->

Historically, truly great leaders of the past never directly told their people how to do their jobs; rather, they explained what needed to be done and established a playing field that allowed their
people to achieve success on their own. Consequently, the follower’s success became a success
for the leader and the organization. When leaders solicit input, they discover the knowledge, interest, and parameters of support. Empowerment enhances organizational performance by
promoting contributions from every member of the organization. Trust is the cornerstone of the
mutually dependent relationship shared by leaders and followers; therefore, leaders must be
flexible and patient in introducing empowerment. By delegating decisions to those closest to the
issues and by allowing Airmen flexibility in how they implement the vision the leader successfully
allows others to take ownership and experience pride in achieving the vision. Recognition is a key
factor in perpetuating improvements. Hence, an important facet of empowerment is the appropriate
recognition of contributions Airmen make to maximizing mission success. 16.22. Empowered Airmen Culture
The USAF aims to build a culture where we identify Airmen’s needs, champion their solutions, eliminate roadblocks, push back detractors, and celebrate the innovative mindset. The Airmen of
today are already well-versed in innovative technologies and will propel us into the USAF of
tomorrow by integrating data-centric processes at the core of our operations. Machine learning and
new technologies will lead us to a new age of human-to-machine teaming by putting Airmen ‘on’
the loop instead of ‘in’ the loop. The USAF will automate where appropriate to free Airmen to do
human things while letting machines do machine things. Maintaining our ability to adapt and innovate quickly is the greatest challenge we face in the future. We are charged with a no-fail mission of providing effective Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and
Global Power—today, tomorrow, and into the future. In modern war, no other nation has achieved
such an asymmetric advantage. If the past two decades have taught us anything, it is that the
demand for airpower is growing. The USAF will seek to increase innovation, and research where
we need to maintain a competitive advantage. Rapid change is the new norm, and it is a major vulnerability to those unable to adapt; however, it
can become an advantage to the agile who are able to swiftly develop and field solutions to
problems. The answers to our most complex security issues will be delivered by harnessing the
power of innovators and entrepreneurs within the USAF, across our country, and throughout the
world. We must drive innovation to secure our future. 16.23. Collaboration Fosters Innovation
Airmen at all levels participate in decision-making. The habits of mind necessary to assure we
apply critical thought are something we must consciously foster. Our highly educated force brings
to the table a wide variety of views, experiences, and abilities; providing the USAF a deep pool
of talent from which to draw ideas. By using the techniques of good decision-making and fostering
the development of habits of mind, we tap into that rich pool of talent. When time allows, we must consciously create processes to think through decisions using critical
analysis of all factors, ensuring we focus on doing what is best for the nation and the USAF. This
effort to create habits of mind pays off when we must make decisions quickly and under great
pressure. During these times we naturally apply the decision-making processes we use every day. The USAF leverages many channels to empower our Airmen and industry partners to submit ideas
as part of our overarching culture of innovation. Collaboration can facilitate ideas and often align
efforts toward innovative concepts and technologies. Partnerships with outside groups, including
traditional and non-traditional industry partners and academia, bring new ideas to the innovation

process. While the USAF is leveraging new and existing technologies to provide rapid and
affordable solutions, it is investing in game-changing technologies, such as autonomous systems, unmanned systems, hypersonic, directed energy, nanotechnology, and stimulating new thinking
about future ways of warfighting and battlefield success.
