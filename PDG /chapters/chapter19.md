### USAF Way of Life
USAF employees are required to comply with prescribed standards of conduct in all official
matters, as well as when off-duty. This means military and civilian Airmen (RegAF, Air Force
Reserve, and Air National Guard) are all expected to maintain high standards of honesty, responsibility, and accountability, as well as adhere to the USAF core values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. As Airmen, we are proud of our high standards, adhere to them, and hold our fellow Airmen accountable. Air Force Standards. The USAF’s mission is critical to national security, global stability, and
international relations. Each member has specific responsibilities for accomplishing his or her part
in the mission. AFI 1-1 states that the importance of the USAF’s mission and its inherent
responsibility to the nation require its members to adhere to higher standards than those expected
in civilian life. While current Department of Defense and USAF policies provide specific
guidance on standards, leaders must ensure members are kept informed of the USAF standards
and take timely and appropriate actions to ensure standards meet the spirit and intent of USAF
policy on proper conduct. 19.2. USAF Publications Process
The USAF shall prepare all publications in accordance with DAFI 90-160, Publications and Forms
Management. This includes, but is not limited to, policy directives, instructions, manuals, mission
directives, and operating instructions. Additional guidance regarding the drafting of mission
directives and operating instructions found in this guidance memorandum does not apply to mission
directives, which are governed by Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 90-1, Headquarters
Air Force Mission Directives and Department of Defense Issuances Program or AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization. DAF Policy Directive (DAFPD). DAFPDs are orders of the Secretary of the Air Force and contain
directive policy statements that guide Department of the Air Force implementation of Department
of Defense issuances or other authorities outside but binding on the Department of Air Force that
require Department of Air Force action. They also
initiate, govern, delegate
authorities/responsibilities, and/or regulate actions within specified areas of responsibility by
Department of Air Force activities. DAFPDs are written clearly and concisely and in a manner that
an average Air and Space Professional can understand. DAFIs, AFIs, and Space Force Instructions (SPFIs). DAFIs, AFIs, and SPFIs are orders of the
Secretary of the Air Force and are certified and approved at the DAF level. DAFIs, AFIs, and
SPFIs generally instruct readers on “what to do,” i.e., direct action, ensure compliance to standard
actions across the DAF. DAFIs, AFIs, and SPFIs are written clearly and concisely and in a manner
that an average Air and Space Professional can understand. DAFIs, AFIs, and SPFIs may be
supplemented at any level below the DAF unless otherwise stated in the publication. DAF Manual DAFMAN, AFMAN or Space Force Manual (SPFMAN). DAFMANs, AFMANs, and SPFMANs are Orders of the Secretary of the Air Force and generally instruct
<!-- Page 363 -->

readers on “how to” and may be either: 1) an extension of a DAFI, AFI, or SPFI, providing detailed
procedure and additional technical guidance for performing standard tasks, or supporting
education and training programs, or 2) an alternative to a DAFI, AFI, or SPFI, if appropriate. DAFMANs, AFMANs, and SPFMANs intended for use only by Air and Space Professionals who
have graduated from special schools (such as flight training, intelligence, or maintenance schools)
may include more specialized and technical language. Publication Series Numbers. Series numbers of publications are organized based on USAF

Nondirective Publications. Nondirective publications are informational and suggest guidance
that may be modified appropriately to fit existing or forecasted circumstances. Complying with
publications in this category is expected, but not mandatory. USAF personnel use these
publications as reference aids or guides. Nondirective publications include pamphlets; basic and
operational doctrine; tactics, techniques, and procedures documents; directories; handbooks; catalogs; visual aids; and product announcements. <!-- Page 364 -->

### On Duty Twenty-Four/Seven
As stated in AFI 1-1, the mission must be accomplished, even at great risk and personal sacrifice. Airmen are always subject to duty, including weekends, holidays, and while on leave. Airmen, if
so directed by a competent authority, must report for duty at any time, at any location, for as long
as necessary. For the mission to succeed, we must always give our best. We must strive to be
resilient—physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually— and be prepared to meet the
challenges inherent to being a member of a fighting force, both in the deployed environment and
at home station. Due to the importance of the USAF mission, the dangers associated with military
service, national and international influences, and potential implications relevant to global
operations, the USAF enforces more restrictive rules and elevated standards than those of the
civilian community. General Orders. General Orders are often published to provide clear and concise guidance
specifically tailored to maintaining good order and discipline in the deployed setting. Our current
operations place us in areas where local laws and customs or mission requirements prohibit or
restrict certain activities that are generally permissible in our society. We must respect and abide
by these restrictions to preserve relations with our host nation and support military operations with
friendly forces. No mission, particularly a combat mission, can succeed without the discipline and
resilience produced by strict compliance with these rules. Members who fail to comply with
General Orders may face adverse administrative action, non-judicial punishment, or criminal
prosecution pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 19.4. Responsibility
USAF standards must be uniformly known, consistently applied, and non-selectively enforced. Accountability is critically important to good order and discipline of the force. Failure to ensure
accountability will hinder the trust of the American public, the very people living under the
Constitution we swore to support and defend, and who look to us, the members of their nation's
USAF, to embrace and live by the standards that are higher than those in the society we serve. Airmen have a responsibility to learn these standards well enough not only to follow them, but to
articulate them clearly to subordinates and enforce proper observation by other members. For
additional information on standards of conduct, refer to 5 CFR 2635, Standards of Ethical
Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, the Joint Ethics Regulation, and AFI 1-1. <!-- Page 365 -->

### Law of War Defined
The law of war, also called the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), is defined by the Department of
Defense as the treaties and customary international law binding on the United States, that regulate: the resort to armed force; the conduct of hostilities and the protection of war victims in
international and non-international armed conflict; belligerent occupation; and the relationships
between belligerent, neutral, and non-belligerent states. Purpose of the Law of War. The law of war arises from civilized nations’ humanitarian desire to
lessen the effects of conflicts. The law of war protects combatants and noncombatants, including
civilians, from unnecessary suffering, and provides fundamental protections for persons who fall
into the hands of the enemy, particularly prisoners of war, civilians, and military wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. The law of war aims to keep conflicts from degenerating into savagery and
brutality, thereby helping restore peace. The law of war also serves to assist commanders in
ensuring the disciplined and efficient use of military force and preserving the professionalism and
humanity of combatants. Law of War Training. DoDD 2311.01, Department of Defense Law of War Program, requires
each military department to implement effective programs that ensure law of war observance, prevent violations, ensure prompt reporting of alleged violations, and appropriately train all forces. Law of war training is an obligation of the United States under provisions of the 1949 Geneva
Conventions, other law of war treaties, and customary international law. USAF personnel receive
law of war training commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. Certain groups, such as
aircrews, medical personnel, and security forces, receive specialized training to address unique
situations they may encounter. Law of War Treaty Obligations. Article six of the U.S. Constitution states that treaty obligations
of the United States are the “supreme law of the land,” and the U.S. Supreme Court has held that
international legal obligations, to include custom, is part of U.S. law. This means that treaties and
international agreements to which the United States is a party, enjoy equal status to laws passed
by Congress and signed by the President. Therefore, all persons subject to United States law must
observe law of war obligations, as well as military personnel, civilians, and contractors authorized
to accompany the U.S. Armed Forces when planning or executing operations. 19.6. Law of War Principles
Five important law of war principles govern armed conflict, and are addressed here: Military Necessity. Military necessity is the law of war principle that justifies the use of all
measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible, that are not prohibited
by the law of war. Attacks must be limited to military objectives. Combatants, unprivileged
belligerents, and civilians taking a direct part in hostilities, are military objectives and may be
made the object of attack. Military objectives, insofar as objects are concerned, include objects
which by their nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action
and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, at the time, offer a definite
military advantage. Examples of these objects generally include tanks, military aircraft, bases, supplies, lines of
<!-- Page 366 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
366
communication, and headquarters. Military necessity does not authorize all military action and
destruction. Under no circumstances may military necessity authorize actions specifically
prohibited by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of war, ill treatment of prisoners of
war or internees, the taking of hostages, or execution or reprisal against a person or object
specifically protected from reprisal. Humanity. The law of war principle of humanity forbids the infliction of suffering, injury, or
destruction unnecessary to accomplish a legitimate military purpose. Although military necessity
justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible, military necessity cannot justify actions not necessary to achieving this purpose. Moreover, once
a military purpose has been achieved, inflicting more suffering is unnecessary and must be
avoided. For example, if any enemy combatant has been placed hors de combat (in other words, taken out of the fight) through incapacitation by being severely wounded or captured, no military
purpose is served by continuing to attack him or her. Similarly, the principle of humanity has been
viewed as the source of the civilian population’s immunity from being made the object of attack
because their inoffensive and harmless character means there is no military purpose served by
attacking them. Distinction. The law of war principle of distinction imposes a requirement to distinguish
(discriminate) between the military forces and the civilian population, and between unprotected
and protected objects. Military force may be directed only against military objectives, and not
against civilian objects. Civilian objects, such as places of worship, schools, hospitals, and
dwellings, are protected from attack. A defender has an obligation to separate civilians and civilian
objects (either in the defender’s country or in an occupied area) from military objectives. However, civilian objects can lose their protected status if they are used to make an effective contribution to
military action. Employment of voluntary or involuntary human shields to protect military
objectives or individual military units or personnel is a fundamental violation of the law of war
principle of distinction. Parties to a conflict must not disguise their military forces as civilians or
as other protected categories of persons to kill or wound opposing forces. Proportionality. Proportionality, as a principle of the law of war, may be defined as the
expectation that even where one is justified in acting, one must not act in a way that is unreasonable
or excessive. Proportionality generally weighs the justification for acting against expected harms
to determine whether the latter are disproportionate in comparison to the former. In war, incidental
damage to the civilian population and civilian objects is unfortunate and tragic, but often
inevitable. Applying the proportionality rule in conducting attacks does not require that no
incidental damage result from attacks. Rather, this rule creates obligations to refrain from attacks
where the expected harm incidental to such attacks would be considered excessive in relation to
the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated to be gained, and to take feasible precautions
in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other protected
persons and objects. Honor. Honor is a principle of the law of war that requires a certain amount of fairness in offense
and defense and a certain mutual respect between opposing military forces. In doing so, honor
reflects the principle that parties to a conflict must accept certain limits on their ability to conduct
hostilities. Honor also forbids the resort to means, expedients, or conduct that would constitute a
breach of trust with the enemy. Enemies must deal with one another in good faith in their nonhostile relations. Even in the conduct of hostilities, good faith prohibits: (1) killing or wounding enemy persons by
resort to perfidy (treachery), (2) misusing certain signs, (3) fighting in the enemy’s uniform, (4)
feigning non-hostile relations to seek a military advantage, and (5) compelling nationals of a
<!-- Page 367 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
367
hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country. Honor, however, does not forbid parties from using ruses and other lawful deceptions against which the
enemy ought to take measures to protect itself. 19.7. The Protection of War Victims and Classes of Persons
The Geneva Conventions of 1949 consist of four separate international treaties that aim to protect
all persons taking no active part in hostilities, including members of military forces who have laid
down their arms and those combatants placed out of the fight due to sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause. These treaties also seek to protect civilians and private property. The Geneva
Conventions also distinguish between combatants, noncombatants, and civilians. Should doubt
exist as to whether a captured individual is a lawful combatant, noncombatant, or an unprivileged
belligerent, the individual will receive the protections of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention
until their actual status is determined. Combatants. Lawful or “privileged” combatants are: (1) members of the military forces of a state
that is a party to a conflict, aside from certain categories of medical and religious personnel; (2)
under certain conditions, members of militia or volunteer corps who are not part of the military
forces of a state, but belong to a state; and (3) inhabitants of an area who participate in a kind of
popular uprising to defend against foreign invaders, known as a levée en masse. A combatant is
commanded by a person responsible for subordinates, wears fixed distinctive emblems/uniforms
recognizable at a distance, carries arms openly, and conducts his or her combat operations
according to the law of war. Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners
of war by opposing military forces. Combatants have a special legal status, as well as certain rights, duties, and liabilities. They have the right to prisoner of war status if they fall into the power of
the enemy during international armed conflict. Combatants have legal immunity from domestic
law for acts done under military authority and in accordance with the law of war. Noncombatants. Noncombatants include certain military personnel who are members of the
military forces not authorized to engage in combatant activities, such as permanent medical and
religious personnel. Noncombatants must be respected and protected and may not be made the
object of attack. Civilians. Civilians, a type of non-combatants, are protected persons and may not be made the
object of direct attack. They may; however, suffer injury or death incident to a direct attack on a
military objective without such an attack violating the law of war, if such attack is on a lawful target
by lawful means and adheres to the principle of proportionality. With the exception of the levée en
masse, the law of war does not authorize civilians to take an active or direct part in hostilities. Civilians who take an active or direct part in hostilities forfeit protection from being made the object
of attack. Unprivileged Belligerents: A Distinction Not Made by the Geneva Conventions. The term
unprivileged belligerent is not used in the Geneva Conventions but is defined in the DoD Law of
War Manual to include “lawful combatants who have forfeited the privileges of combatant status
by engaging in spying or sabotage, and private persons who have forfeited one or more of the
protections of civilian status by engaging in hostilities.” An unprivileged belligerent is an
individual who is not authorized by a state that is party to a conflict to take part in hostilities but
does so anyway. 19.8. Military Objectives
Military objectives include any object which by its nature, location, purpose, or use, makes an
effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or
<!-- Page 368 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
368
neutralization in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. Protection of Civilians and Civilian Objects. Military objectives may not be attacked when the
expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects would
be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained. In
general, military operations must not be directed against civilians. In particular, civilians must not
be made the object of attack and must not be used as shields or hostages. Measures of intimidation
or terrorism against the civilian population are prohibited, including acts or threats of violence
with the primary purpose of spreading terror. The principle, that military operations must not be
directed against civilians, does not prohibit military operations, short of violence, that are militarily
necessary. For example, such operations may include stopping and searching civilians for
weapons and verifying that they are civilians; temporarily detaining civilians for reasons of
mission accomplishment, self-defense, or for their own safety; collecting intelligence from
civilians, including interrogating civilians; restricting the movement of civilians, or directing their
movement away from military operations for their own protection; or seeking to influence enemy
civilians with propaganda. Feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and civilian objects must be taken when
planning and conducting attacks, and in connection with certain types of weapons. Also, feasible
precautions should be taken to mitigate the burden on civilians when seizing or destroying enemy
property. Commanders and other decision-makers must make decisions in good faith and based on
the information available to them. Even when information is imperfect or lacking, as will
frequently be the case during armed conflict, commanders and other decision-makers may direct
and conduct military operations, so long as they make a good faith assessment of the information
that is available to them at the time. Judge advocates, intelligence, and operations personnel play
a critical role in determining the propriety of a target and the choice of weapon to be used under
the particular circumstances known to the commander when planning an attack. Protected Objects. The law of war provides specific protection to certain objects, including
medical units or establishments; transports of wounded and sick personnel; military and civilian
hospital ships; safety zones established under the Geneva Conventions; religious, cultural, and
charitable buildings; monuments; and prisoner of war camps. However, if these protected objects
are used for military purposes, they may lose their protected status. An attack on protected objects
near lawful military objectives, that suffer collateral damage when the nearby military objectives
are lawfully engaged, does not violate the law of war, subject to adherence to the principle of
proportionality. Enemy Aircraft and Aircrew. Enemy military aircraft may be attacked and destroyed, unless in
neutral airspace or territory. Airmen who parachute from a disabled aircraft and offer no resistance
may not be attacked. Airmen who resist in descent or are downed behind their own lines and who
continue to fight may be subject to attack. The rules of engagement for a particular operation often
include additional guidance for attacking enemy aircraft consistent with law of war obligations. An enemy’s public and private nonmilitary aircraft are generally not subject to attack unless used
for a military purpose. If a civil aircraft initiates an attack, it may be considered an immediate military threat and may be
lawfully attacked (on the basis it qualifies as a military objective). An immediate military threat
justifying an attack may also exist when reasonable suspicion exists of a hostile intent, such as
when a civil aircraft approaches a military base at high speed or enters enemy territory without
permission and disregards signals or warnings to land or proceed to a designated place. Military medical aircraft are used exclusively for the removal of the wounded and sick and for
<!-- Page 369 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
369
the transport of medical personnel and equipment. Military medical aircraft are entitled to
protection from attack by enemy combatants while flying at heights, times, and on routes
specifically agreed upon between the parties to the conflict. Under the law of war, a military
medical aircraft found to be in violation of established agreements could be lawfully attacked and
destroyed after all other means of control (such as directing the aircraft to land and submit to
search) have been exhausted. 19.9. Enforcing Law of War Rules
All Department of Defense personnel, including contractors when assigned to or accompanying
deployed armed forces, comply with the law of war during all armed conflicts and military
operations. Law of war principles and rules are consistent with military doctrine for a profession
of arms and is the basis for effective combat operations. Following doctrinal guidance, such as
accuracy of targeting, concentration of effort, maximization of military advantage, conservation
of resources, avoidance of excessive collateral damage, and economy of force, is consistent with
the law of war and reinforces compliance. Each member of the armed services has a duty to comply
with the law of war, which includes the refusal to comply with clearly illegal orders to commit law
of war violations. For law of war violations, members may be prosecuted by courts-martial under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice or through an international military tribunal. Reporting Violations. Department of Defense personnel who suspect or have information which
might reasonably be viewed as a violation of the law of war committed by or against U.S. personnel, enemy personnel, or any other individual, shall promptly report the violation to their
immediate commander or the proper authority. This includes violations by the enemy, allies, U.S. Armed Forces, or others. If the allegation involves or may involve a U.S. commander, the report
should be made to the next higher United States command authority. Particular circumstances may
require that the report be made to the nearest judge advocate, inspector general, a special agent in
the Office of Special Investigations, or a security forces member. 19.10. Rules of Engagement
Rules of engagement exist to ensure use of force in an operation occurs according to national
policy goals, mission requirements, and the rule of law. In general, rules of engagement set
parameters for when, where, how, why, and against whom commanders and their Airmen may use
force. All Airmen have a duty and a legal obligation to understand, remember, and apply rules of
engagement. The standing rules of engagement are approved by the U.S. President and Secretary
of Defense and are issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They provide
implementation guidance on the inherent right of self-defense and the application of force for
mission accomplishment. Note: Mission-specific rules of engagement present a more specific
application of law of war principles tailored to the political and military nature of a mission which
are generally contained in an annex to execution orders, operations plans, and operations orders. Commanders at every echelon have an obligation to ensure that all operations comply with the
mission rules of engagement and/or with the standing rules of engagement, as applicable. Self Defense. The fundamental U.S. policy on self-defense is repeatedly stated throughout the
standing rules of engagement, “These rules do not limit a commander’s inherent authority and
obligation to use all necessary means available to take all appropriate actions in self-defense of
the commander’s unit and other U.S. Armed Forces in the vicinity.” Military members may act
in individual self-defense unless otherwise directed by a unit commander. Several factors must
be considered before the use of force in unit or individual self-defense. De-escalation. When time and circumstances permit, the forces committing hostile acts or
demonstrating hostile intent should be warned and given the opportunity to withdraw or cease
<!-- Page 370 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
370
threatening actions. Necessity. Necessity in the context of self-defense under the rules of engagement focuses on the
threat perceived by an individual, that is whether the individual perceives a hostile act has
occurred, or hostile intent is being demonstrated. Hostile act and hostile intent includes force or
threats of force used against the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, designated persons and
property, or intended to impede the mission of U.S. Armed Forces. Proportionality. Proportionality in the context of self-defense under the rules of engagement
relates to the reasonableness of the response to a threat. In self-defense, U.S. Armed Forces may
only use the amount of force necessary to decisively counter a hostile act or a demonstration of
hostile intent and ensure the continued safety of U.S. Armed Forces or other designated persons
and property. Force used must be reasonable in nature, duration and scope compared to the threat
based on facts known to the individual at the time. Pursuit. U.S. Armed Forces can pursue and engage a hostile force that has committed a hostile
act or demonstrated a hostile intent if those forces continue to commit hostile acts or demonstrate
hostile intent. Applicable rules of engagement may restrict or place limitations on U.S. Armed
Forces’ ability to pursue or engage a hostile force across an international border. <!-- Page 371 -->

### Responsibilities under the Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct is a moral code designed to provide U.S. military personnel with a standard
of conduct that all members are expected to measure up to. The six articles of the Code of Conduct
were designed to address situations that any member could encounter to some degree. It includes
basic information useful to prisoners of war to help them survive honorably while resisting captors’
efforts to exploit them. It is also applicable to service members subject to other hostile detention, such as hostage scenarios. Survival and resistance in hostile situations requires knowledge and
understanding of the six articles. Violations of the Code of Conduct are not criminally punishable
per se, but actions that also violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) may subject
members to disciplinary action. Code of Conduct Training. Department of Defense personnel who plan, schedule, commit, or
control members of the U.S. Armed Forces must fully understand the Code of Conduct and ensure
personnel have the training and education necessary to abide by it. The level of knowledge
members need depends on how likely they are to be captured, their exposure to sensitive
information, and how useful or valuable a captor considers them to be. Code of Conduct training
is conducted at three levels, briefly described here. Level A—Entry Level Training. Level A training represents the minimum level of understanding
needed for all members of the U.S. Armed Forces. This level is imparted to all personnel during
entry training. Level B—Training After Assumption of Duty Eligibility. Level B training is an enhanced
version of training from Level A. It is the minimum level of understanding needed for service
members whose military jobs, specialties, or assignments entail moderate risk of capture, such as
members of ground combat units. Training is conducted for such service members as soon as their
assumption of duty makes them eligible. Level C—Training Upon Assumption of Duties or Responsibilities. Level C training is an
enhanced version of training from Levels A and B. It is the minimum level of understanding
needed for military service members whose military jobs, specialties, or assignments entail
significant or high risk of capture and whose position, rank, or seniority makes them vulnerable to
greater-than-average exploitation efforts by a captor. Examples include aircrews and special
mission forces, such as pararescue teams. Training for these members is conducted upon their
assumption of the duties or responsibilities that make them eligible. 19.12. The Articles of the Code of Conduct
President Dwight D. Eisenhower first published the Code of Conduct for members of the U.S. Armed Forces on 17 August 1955. In March 1988, President Ronald W. Reagan amended the code
with gender-neutral language. The six articles of the Code of Conduct are listed below, followed
by an explanation of each article and significant aspects of that article. <!-- Page 372 -->

I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of
life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. ARTICLE I
I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender
the members of my command while they still have the means to resist. ARTICLE II
ARTICLE III
If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every
effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special
favors from the enemy. ARTICLE IV
If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give
no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those
appointed over me and will back them up in every way. ARTICLE V
When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to
the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my
country and its allies or harmful to their cause. ARTICLE VI
I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my
actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in
my God and in the United States of America. ARTICLE I. Article I applies to all members at all times. A member of the U.S. Armed Forces
has a duty to support U.S. interests and oppose U.S. enemies regardless of the circumstances, whether in active combat or captivity. Past experiences of captured Americans reveals that
honorable survival in captivity requires a high degree of dedication and motivation. Maintaining
these qualities requires knowledge of and a strong belief in the advantages of American democratic
institutions and concepts. Maintaining these qualities also requires a love of and faith in the United
States and a conviction that the United States’ cause is just. Honorable survival in captivity
depends on faith in, and loyalty to, fellow prisoners of war. Note: Possessing the dedication and
motivation fostered by such beliefs and trust may help prisoners of war survive long, stressful
periods of captivity, and has helped many return to their country and families with their honor and
self-esteem intact. <!-- Page 373 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
373
ARTICLE II. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces may never surrender voluntarily. Even when
isolated and no longer able to inflict casualties on the enemy or otherwise defend themselves, their
duty is to evade capture and rejoin the nearest friendly force. Surrender is the willful act of giving
oneself up to the enemy. In contrast, capture occurs when a member has no means to resist, evasion
is impossible, and further fighting would lead to death of the U.S. member with no significant loss
to the enemy. Capture dictated by overwhelming enemy strength and the futility of fighting is not
dishonorable. Service members must understand and have confidence in search and recovery
forces rescue procedures and techniques, and proper evasion destination procedures. Note: Under
the UCMJ, a U.S. commander who shamefully surrenders to the enemy, any command or place
that is his or her duty to defend, is subject to punishment. In addition, any person subject to the
UCMJ who compels or attempts to compel a commander of any place, vessel, aircraft, or other
military property, or of any body of members of the Armed Forces, to give it up to an enemy or to
abandon it, or who strikes the colors or flag to an enemy without proper authority, is subject to
punishment. ARTICLE III. A U.S. Armed Forces member’s duty to continue to resist enemy exploitation by
all means available is not lessened by the misfortune of capture. Contrary to the 1949 Geneva
Conventions, enemies that United States forces have engaged since 1949 have treated the prisoner
of war compound as an extension of the battlefield. The prisoner of war must be prepared for this. Enemies have used a variety of tactics to exploit prisoners of war for propaganda purposes or to
obtain military information, in spite of Geneva Conventions prohibitions. Physical and mental
harassment, general mistreatment, torture, medical neglect, and political indoctrination have all
been used, and the enemy has tried to tempt prisoners of war to accept special favors or privileges
in return for statements or information, or for a pledge by the prisoner of war not to attempt escape. A prisoner of war must not seek special privileges or accept special favors at the expense of fellow
prisoners of war. Under the guidance and supervision of the senior military person, the prisoner of
war must be prepared to take advantage of escape opportunities. In communal detention, the
welfare of the prisoners of war who remain behind must be considered. Additionally, prisoners of
war should not sign or enter into a parole agreement. Parole agreements are promises the prisoners
of war make to the captor to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms, in exchange for
special privileges, such as release or lessened restraint. Members should understand that captivity involves continuous control by a captor who may
attempt to use the prisoner of war as a source of information for political purposes or as a potential
subject for political indoctrination. Members must familiarize themselves with prisoner of war and
captor rights and obligations under the Geneva Conventions, understanding that some captors have
accused prisoners of war of being war criminals simply because they waged war against them. Continued efforts to escape are critical because a successful escape causes the enemy to divert
forces that may otherwise be fighting, provides the United States valuable information about the
enemy and other prisoners of war, and serves as a positive example to all members of the U.S. Armed Forces. ARTICLE IV. Officers and enlisted members continue to carry out their responsibilities and
exercise authority in captivity. Informing, or any other action detrimental to a fellow prisoner of
war, is despicable and expressly forbidden. Prisoners of war must avoid helping the enemy identify
fellow prisoners of war who may have valuable knowledge to the enemy. Strong leadership is
essential to discipline. Without discipline, camp organization, resistance, and even survival may
be impossible. Personal hygiene, camp sanitation, and care of the sick and wounded are imperative. Wherever located, prisoners of war must organize in a military manner under the senior military
prisoner of war, regardless of military service. If the senior prisoner of war is incapacitated or
otherwise unable to act, the next senior prisoner of war assumes command. <!-- Page 374 -->

Members must be trained to understand and accept leadership from those in command and abide
by the decisions of the senior prisoner of war, regardless of military service. Failing to do so may
result in punishment under the UCMJ. Additionally, a prisoner of war who voluntarily informs or
collaborates with the captor is a traitor to the United States and fellow prisoners of war, and after
repatriation, is subject to punishment under the UCMJ. Service members must be familiar with the
principles of hygiene, sanitation, health maintenance, first aid, physical conditioning, and food
utilization. ARTICLE V. When questioned, a prisoner of war is required by the Geneva Conventions, and
permitted by the UCMJ, to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Under the Geneva
Conventions, the enemy has no right to try to force a prisoner of war to provide any additional
information. However, it is unrealistic to expect a prisoner of war to remain confined for years
reciting only name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Many prisoner of war camp situations
exist in which certain types of conversation with the enemy are permitted. For example, a prisoner
of war is allowed, but not required by the Code of Conduct, the UCMJ, or the Geneva Conventions, to fill out a Geneva Conventions capture card, to write letters home, and to communicate with
captors on matters of health and welfare. The senior prisoner of war is required to represent
prisoners of war in matters of camp administration, health, welfare, and grievances. A prisoner of
war must resist, avoid, or evade, even when physically and mentally coerced, all enemy efforts to
secure statements or actions that may further the enemy’s cause. Examples of statements or actions
prisoners of war should resist include giving oral or written confessions, answering questionnaires, providing personal history statements, and making propaganda recordings and broadcast appeals
to other prisoners of war to comply with improper captor demands. Additionally, prisoners of war
should resist appealing for United States surrender or parole; engaging in self-criticism; or
providing oral or written statements or communication that are harmful to the United States, its
allies, the U.S. Armed Forces, or other prisoners of war. Experience has shown that, although
enemy interrogation sessions may be harsh and cruel, a prisoner of war can usually resist if there
is a will to resist. The best way for a prisoner of war to keep faith with the United States fellow
prisoners of war, and him or herself, is to provide the enemy with as little information as possible. Service members familiarize themselves with the various aspects of interrogation, including
phases, procedures, methods, and techniques, as well as the interrogator’s goals, strengths, and
weaknesses. Members should avoid disclosing information by such techniques as claiming
inability to furnish information because of previous orders, poor memory, ignorance, or lack of
comprehension. They should understand that, short of death, it is unlikely that a prisoner of war
will prevent a skilled enemy interrogator, using all available psychological and physical methods
of coercion, from obtaining some degree of compliance. However, the prisoner of war must
recover as quickly as possible and resist successive efforts to the utmost. ARTICLE VI. A member of the U.S. Armed Forces remains responsible for personal actions at
all times. When repatriated, prisoners of war can expect their actions to be subject to review, including both circumstances of capture and conduct during detention. The purpose of such a
review is to recognize meritorious performance and, if necessary, investigate any allegations of
misconduct. Such reviews are conducted with due regard for the rights of the individual and
consideration for the conditions of captivity. Members should understand the difference between
the Code of Conduct as a moral code and the UCMJ as a legal code. Members should understand
that failure to follow the Code of Conduct could ultimately lead them to commit misconduct
punishable under the UCMJ. Members should also understand that the U.S. Government will use
every available means to establish contact with prisoners of war, to support them, and to obtain
their release. Furthermore, U.S. laws provide for the support and care of dependents of the U.S. Armed Forces, including prisoners of war family members. Military members must ensure their

personal affairs and family matters are up to date at all times. Note: No United States prisoner of
war will be forgotten. Every available means will be employed to establish contact with, support, and obtain the release of all our U.S. prisoners of war. 19.13. Detention of U.S. Military Personnel in Operations Other than War
U.S. military personnel isolated from U.S. control are still required to do everything in their power
to follow Department of Defense and USAF policy and survive with honor. Basic protections
available to prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions may not be adhered to during
operations other than war; thus, personnel detained may be subject to the domestic criminal laws
of the detaining nation. These personnel should use the Code of Conduct as a moral guide to assist
them to uphold the ideals of Department of Defense policy and survive their ordeal with honor. Rationale. Because of their wide range of activities, U.S. military personnel are subject to
detention by unfriendly governments or captivity by terrorist groups. When a hostile government
or terrorist group detains or captures U.S. military personnel, the captor is often attempting to
exploit both the individual and the U.S. Government for its own purposes. As history has shown, exploitation can take many forms, such as hostage confessions to crimes never committed, international news media exploitation, and substantial ransom demands, all of which can lead to
increased credibility and support for the detainer. Responsibility. U.S. military personnel detained by unfriendly governments or held hostage by a
terrorist group must do everything in their power to survive with honor. Furthermore, whether
United States military personnel are detained or held hostage, they can be sure the U.S. Government will make every effort to obtain their release. To best survive the situation, military
personnel must maintain faith in their country, in fellow detainees or captives, and most
importantly, in themselves. In any group captivity situation, military captives must organize to the
fullest extent possible under the senior military member present. If civilians are part of the group, they should be encouraged to participate. United States military personnel must make every
reasonable effort to prevent captors from exploiting them and the U.S. Government. If exploitation
cannot be prevented, military members must attempt to limit it. If detainees convince their captors
of their low propaganda value, the captors may seek a quick end to the situation. When a detention
or hostage situation ends, military members who can honestly say they did their utmost to resist
exploitation will have upheld Department of Defense policy, the founding principles of the United
States, and the highest traditions of military service. Military Bearing and Courtesy. U.S. military personnel shall maintain military bearing, regardless of the type of detention or captivity, or brutality of treatment. They should make every
effort to remain calm and courteous, and project personal dignity, particularly during the process
of capture and the early stages of internment when captors may be uncertain of their control over
the captives. Discourteous, nonmilitary behavior seldom serves long-term interests of a detainee
or hostage and often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful purpose. Such
behavior may jeopardize survival and complicate efforts to gain release of the detainee or hostage. Guidance for Detention by Governments. Detainees in the custody of an unfriendly government, regardless of the circumstances that resulted in the detention, are subject to the laws of that
government. Detainees must maintain military bearing and avoid aggressive, combative, or illegal
behavior that may complicate their situation, legal status, or efforts to negotiate a rapid release. As
American citizens, detainees should ask immediately and continually to see United States embassy
personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government. United States military personnel
who become lost or isolated in an unfriendly foreign country during operations other than war will
not act as combatants during evasion attempts. During operations other than war, there is no
<!-- Page 376 -->

376
protection afforded under the Geneva Conventions. The civil laws of that country apply. A detainer’s goal may be maximum political exploitation. Detained U.S. military personnel must
be cautious in all they say and do. In addition to asking for a U.S. representative, detainees should
provide name, rank, service number, date of birth, and the innocent circumstances leading to their
detention. They should limit further discussions to health and welfare matters, conditions of their
fellow detainees, and going home. Detainees should avoid signing documents or making statements. If forced, they must provide as
little information as possible. U.S. military detainees should not refuse release, unless doing so
requires them to compromise their honor or cause damage to the U.S. Government or its allies. Attempting to escape by unfriendly governments is not recommended by Department of Defense
policy except under life threatening circumstances. This is because attempted or actual escape from
a government confinement facility will likely constitute a violation of the unfriendly government’s
criminal law and may subject the escapee to increased criminal prosecution. Terrorist Hostage. Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of
operations. Capture can range from a spontaneous kidnapping to a carefully planned hijacking. In
either situation, hostages play an important role in determining their own fate because terrorists
rarely expect to receive rewards for providing good treatment or releasing victims unharmed. U.S. military members should assume their captors are genuine terrorists when it is unclear if they are
surrogates of a government. A terrorist hostage situation is more volatile than a government
detention, so members must take steps to lessen the chance of a terrorist indiscriminately killing
hostages. In such a situation, Department of Defense policy accepts and promotes efforts to
establish rapport between United States hostages and the terrorists to establish themselves as
people in the terrorist’s mind, rather than a stereotypical symbol of a country the terrorist may
hate. Department of Defense policy recommends U.S. personnel stay away from topics that could
inflame terrorist sensibilities, such as their cause, politics, or religion. Listening can be vitally
important when survival is at stake. Members should not argue, patronize, or debate issues with
the captors. During rescue attempts, hostages should take cover, remain stationary when
practicable, and not attempt to help rescuers. Hostages may experience rough handling from the
rescuers until the rescuers separate the terrorists from the hostages.
