### DAFMAN 36-2905, Air Force Physical Fitness Program
According to AFI 1-1, USAF members must be physically fit to support the USAF mission. An
active lifestyle increases productivity, optimizes health, and decreases absenteeism, which helps
maintain a higher level of readiness. Health and readiness benefits increase as body composition
improves and physical activity and fitness levels increase. Members are encouraged to optimize
their readiness status by improving their overall fitness. The goal of the Physical Fitness Program
(PFP) is to motivate all Airmen to participate in a year-round physical conditioning program that
emphasizes total fitness, to include proper aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training, and
healthy eating. Note: Refer to the latest version of DAFMAN 36-2905 for the most current fitness
standards. This guidance is applicable to the entire Department of the Air Force, including
uniformed members of the RegAF, the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard, and the United
States Space Force. 22.2. Roles & Responsibilities Snapshot

assessment. Notifies UFPM upon receiving an AF Form 469 from healthcare provider with fitness
restrictions and or fitness assessment exemptions in accordance with AFI 48-133. Then provides
a copy of AF Form 469 to FAC staff, augmentee, or PTL prior to taking assessment. Submits any
updates via FSQ, prior to completing an assessment. ARC Airmen will ensure they are in a
qualified duty status for assessments. For safety, Airmen must understand and comply with the
guidelines contained in AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, regarding the use of weight
control drugs and surgery. 22.3. Body Composition Program
Effective
January 2023, in accordance with DoDI 1308.03, DoD Physical Fitness/Body
Composition Program, which mandates military services establish body composition
requirements for servicemembers to ensure physical readiness, the Air Force will implement a
new Body Composition Program (BCP) replacing the abdominal circumference measurement
removed from the Physical Fitness Assessments in December 2020. The BCP requires Air Force
military members to complete an annual Body Composition Assessment (BCA) within their birth
month and uses the Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) to calculate body composition by dividing
waist circumference by height. Implementation of the BCP for the Air Force started on 1 April 2023, with a one-year adaptation
period. Administrative actions are not authorized based solely on the results of BCAs assessed in
the adaptation period. This period was extended on 8 April 2024 and remains in effect until 180
days after the publication of AFMAN 36-2912, Air Force Body Composition Program. During
this time, administrative actions based solely on BCA results are not authorized. 22.4. BCA Assessment. The initial recorded BCA is considered a “baseline assessment.”
Continual evaluation is conducted of the BCP during the adaptation period. The assessment
implemented provides a military standard for body composition and an associated health risk to
meet Air Force service requirements: Meeting Standard (Low-Moderate Risk): (WHtR < 0.55)
Not Meeting Standard (High Risk): (WHtR > 0.55)
### BCA Roles & Responsibilities Snapshot
The BCP is a unit commander driven program. Units will adhere to the following policy guidance
published on 5 January 2023 when administering the BCP: Commanders or equivalents. Commanders or equivalents will execute, enforce, and ensure
administration of BCA across the unit by providing safe facilities and equipment, necessary
resources, and funding to support the BCP. Identify male and female Body Composition
Managers (BCM) within units to administer BCAs and manage the IT system platform
(myBodyComp) for their unit/PAS Code. Units must have at least one of each sex; there is no
grade requirement. Purchase required equipment (e.g., non-stretch tape measure in inches). Enroll
Airmen initially identified during the adaptation period with a WHtR of > 0.55 into a 12-month
required informal self-directed Body Composition Improvement Program (BCIP) using the DAF
Form 108, Department of the Air Force Fitness Education and Intervention Processing, until
publication of the new DAF Form 113, Department of the Air Force Body Composition
Assessment Scorecard and Intervention Worksheet. Enrollment in the informal self-directed BCIP is not considered a failure to meet the BCP
standard. Commanders will not take administrative actions during the informal self-directed
BCIP. <!-- Page 419 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
419
Commanders or equivalents will encourage compliance with the body composition improvement
plan developed by Airmen and reassess WHtR after completing the informal self-directed BCIP. Enroll Airmen in a formal self-directed BCIP after subsequent failures to achieve BCP standards
using the DAF Form 108 until publication of the new DAF Form 113. Enrollment in the formal self-directed BCIP is considered the first failure to meet the BCP
standard. Reassessments will be conducted during the next birth month or 12 months from the
last BCA. When no medical condition exists that would preclude Airmen from meeting the BCP standard, commanders or equivalents will consider administrative actions to include separation for repeated
failures. Body Composition Managers (BCM). BCMs will attend mandatory training before executing
duties as required by the BCP. Training dates are forthcoming via MyPers messaging. Administer
BCAs within the unit and only assess members of the same sex. BCMs will utilize members’ sex
reflected in Military Personnel Data System for BCAs. Input WHtR results into myBodyComp to
include exemptions. Communicate program requirements (e.g., body composition improvement
plan) for Airmen enrolled in informal and formal self-directed BCIP and assist members using the
DAF Form 108 until publication of the new DAF Form 113. Provide unit BCP metrics and reports
available in the myBodyComp platform to the unit commander upon request. Inform the unit
commander of Airmen who do not meet program requirements (i.e., overdue BCA, not meeting
BCP standards, non-compliance with program requirements). Airmen. Airmen will assess annually within their birth month or 12 months (out-of-cycle
assessment). To ensure decoupling of the PFA and to allow for mission and personal flexibility, members may opt to accomplish their BCA one calendar month before their birth month or
reassessment date. BCAs will not be taken when a member is provided a deployment, commander, or ARC non-participating exemption. Members are required to accomplish a BCA within two
months after the exemption expiration. Note: all members will have a BCA taken when on a
medical restriction unless a profile (AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report) indicates a
BCA exemption. Airmen will complete the following if identified with a WHtR of > 0.55: Enroll in the 12-month informal self-directed BCIP and reassess WHtR upon completion. Schedule a medical evaluation and assessment for risk factors with their Medical Treatment
Facility. ARC members will schedule a medical records review with the Reserve Medical
Unit/Guard Medical Unit. Review the Health and Readiness Optimization (HeRO) Body
Composition Guide, which provides information and resources on achieving a healthy body
composition. Develop a body composition improvement action plan that outlines the strategy, resources, and counseling options the member will use and submit it to the BCM and unit
commander. Airmen will complete the following if identified as not meeting standards (WHtR > 0.55) after
completion of the informal self-directed program: Enroll in the formal self-directed BCIP. Review, continue, and/or adjust body composition
improvement plan utilizing resources to achieve the BCP standard (e.g., Medical, HeRO
Guide, local helping agencies). Reassess WHtR during the next birth month or 12 months from
the last BCA (out-of-cycle assessment). Re-enroll in formal self-directed BCIP if identified as
failing to meet standard after subsequently meeting standard. <!-- Page 420 -->

### Fitness Assessment Procedures
Adequate physical fitness levels ensure every Airman can properly support the USAF mission
while performing at optimal capacity. All components of the fitness assessment must be completed
within a three-hour window on the same day. If FAC staff or augmentees determine extenuating
circumstances prevent completion of the test, for example, rapidly changing or severe weather
conditions, natural disasters, emergencies, or safety issues, then all components must be rescheduled
and completed at the earliest opportunity. The body composition component is the first component
of the fitness assessment. It includes measuring height and weight followed by the muscular
strength components (1-minute push-ups, or 2-minute hand release push-ups (HRPU)). Next is the
Core Endurance (1-minute sit-ups, 2-minute cross leg reverse crunch (CLRC), or timed forearm
plank). Finally, the Cardiorespiratory Fitness is last (1.5-mile run, 20 meter HAMR or the 2
kilometer walk (if not medically cleared to run). There is a minimum five-minute rest period
between components. Note: The assessment components should be scheduled to allow adequate
rest for members on irregular or shift work hours. Also, Reserve members must be in a duty status
for fitness assessments. ARC Airmen will be required to retest no later than the next Unit Training
Assembly or Regularly Scheduled Drill when official fitness assessments are being conducted. Videotaping of fitness assessments is not allowed, nor should it be used in the appeal process. Fitness Screening Questionnaire. A fitness screening questionnaire will be completed in
myFitness when scheduling prior to the fitness assessment, to provide time for medical evaluation, when indicated. Failure to complete the fitness screening questionnaire does not invalidate the
fitness assessment. Member must inform PFA Administrator if FSQ responses have changed
between original submission of FSQ and execution of PFA. 22.7. Fitness Assessment Composite Score
The composite fitness scores are used to determine the overall fitness assessment score. Aerobic
fitness is evaluated by a three-component physical fitness assessment consisting of the 1.5-mile
run (medical alternate 2 km walk) or optional high aerobic multi-shuttle run (20M HAMR), one
minute push-ups or optional hand release push-ups, and sit-ups or optional cross-leg reverse crunch
or plank. Airmen receive a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale based on the following maximum
component scores: 60 points for aerobic component
## points for muscular component
## points for sit-up component
Minimum Scores. The minimum component scores are established to ensure members test
adequately in all components. Meeting the minimum score in each of the components does not
constitute the minimum points required to earn a passing fitness assessment score. Scoring the
minimum component values in all components will not generate enough points to earn a composite
score of 75 or greater. Age and sex-specific fitness assessment score charts are provided in myFSS. Note: When reviewing the charts, make note of both the minimum and maximum requirements
associated with specific categories to assess progress and tailor training to strive for higher scores
in each of the components for overall fitness assessment results and personal fitness levels. <!-- Page 421 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Fitness Assessment Results. There are three fitness assessment levels that can be achieved, as
well as an exempt category, briefly described here: Excellent. To achieve a fitness assessment level of excellent, a composite score at or above 90
is required. If all three (applicable) components of the fitness assessment were scored at or
above 90, the individual will retest within 12 months. If fewer than three components of the
fitness assessment were scored at or above 90, and the individual is not on a chronic profile, then the individual will retest within six months. Satisfactory. To achieve a fitness assessment level of satisfactory, a composite score of 7589.99 is required. The individual will retest within six months. Unsatisfactory. To achieve a fitness assessment level of unsatisfactory, a composite score at
or below 74.9 and/or one or more component minimums was not met. The individual will retest
within 90 days. Component Exemption. An Airman is exempt from one or more components of the fitness
assessment but will be assessed on remaining components. Composite Exemption. An Airman is exempt from all components of the fitness assessment. 22.8. Documenting Assessment Failures
Assessment failures will be annotated in myFitness (myFSS) and will be considered against the
individual. If a member fails their fitness assessment, the commander has the discretion to annotate
a non-current/failing assessment within the reporting period on the performance evaluation. Additionally, it is the commander’s discretion to document the evaluation as a referral for a noncurrent/failing assessment at the evaluation close-out date. Commander responses for fitness
assessment failures range from verbal counseling to placement on control roster, to administrative
separation. A more complete list of commander response options for fitness assessment failures is
provided in DAFMAN 36-2905. Deployments. Composite scores represent a health-based fitness level. As the fitness level
increases, Airmen are able to tolerate extremes in temperature, fatigue, and stress while optimizing
performance in the deployed environment. Members must have a current fitness score on file prior
to deployment. Members will not be considered “exempt” in the deployed location until their
current fitness assessment expires. Medical Exemptions and Profiles. Medical providers may recommend temporary or permanent
medical exemptions for medical conditions preventing an Airman from safely participating in
specific physical conditioning programs or in a component of the fitness assessment. The
commander, in consultation with the fitness program manager, and upon medical provider
recommendation, may grant members exemption from aerobic and muscle fitness components for
a limited period of time. Exemptions for medical reasons are entered into myFSS using the
individual’s current AF Form 469, following assessment completion. Airmen with a medical
profile prohibiting them from performing one or more of the components of the fitness assessment
will still be tested on the components not specifically exempted. For additional details on fitness
assessments, refer to DAFMAN 36-2905. 22.9. Fitness Assessment Components – Explained
To assess total fitness, the fitness assessment components include muscular fitness (to include
push-ups and sit-ups), and aerobic fitness. Muscular Fitness. Muscular fitness includes both muscular strength and muscular endurance. <!-- Page 422 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
422
Muscular strength is the maximum force generated by a specific muscle or muscle group. Muscular
endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions over a period of
sufficient time to cause muscular fatigue. Muscular fitness helps with metabolism, strengthens
connective tissue, increases bond density, helps facilitate recovery from physical activity, helps
prevent injury, may increase cardiorespiratory fitness, and may improve mood and self-image. Muscular fitness resistance training includes performing calisthenics; plyometrics; field exercises; and weight/object training, such as machines, free weights, medicine balls, kettle bells, bands, cables, and ropes. Movement patterns can include running, bending, twisting, squatting, pulling, and pushing. Body regions that can be targeted include core, lower body, upper body, and whole
body. By incorporating a variety of combinations of muscular fitness resistance training, weight/object training, and movement patterns, a wide range of exercises are available for a
challenging, engaging workout routine. Aerobic Fitness. Cardiorespiratory endurance, known as aerobic fitness, is the ability to perform
large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity exercise for prolonged periods. Performance of
such exercise depends on the functional state of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle
systems, more simply defined as the ability to produce energy. Many modes of activity meet
aerobic activity requirements, such as cross-country skiing, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing, walking, aerobic dance, indoor aerobic exercise machines, and sports that require
continuous physical exertion. The level of aerobic fitness determines how long and how hard a
person can exercise. Moderately Intense Aerobic Activity. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to
continuous exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates sweating (varies with
climate), and permits conversation or controlled breathing. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day /
five days a week. Vigorously Intense Aerobic Activity. Vigorously intense aerobic activity elicits higher
physiological responses and permits light or broken conversation. Aim for at least 20 – 25
minutes a day / three days a week. Intensity Calculations. Intensity, considered the most important variable in training, can be
measured by the percentage of maximal oxygen consumed or by the percentage of maximal
heart rate. Various approaches are available for calculating training intensity. USAF fitness
personnel can help determine calculations to safely achieve individual fitness preferences and
objectives. The key thing to remember when exercising is to elevate your heart rate to a safe
level to achieve the desired training effect. Also, adjustments in mode, frequency, duration, and intensity may be necessary to reach higher levels of health and fitness. 22.10. Additional Fitness Concepts and Principles
There are several additional fitness principles that should be applied to a fitness routine. Fitness
routines do not need to be complicated. They can be simplified, tailored to individual needs, and
designed to address certain concepts to help maximize training efforts and benefits. Pre-Workout Warm-up. Warm-ups help increase body temperature and blood flow, and guard
against muscle, tendon, and ligament strains. Before beginning any vigorous physical activity, prepare your body for exercise with a warm-up. A five to seven minute dynamic warm-up increases
the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of injury and increasing
the joint’s range of motion, positively affecting the speed of muscular contraction. A recommended
sequence of dynamic warm-up activities before vigorous exercise is provided here. Slowly jog in place or walk to generate a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, <!-- Page 423 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
423
circulation, and temperature of the active muscles. Slowly rotate joints to gradually increase their range of motion. Slowly mimic the activities to be performed. When warming up for weight lifting, lifting lighter
weights helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways. Post-Workout Cool-down. Cool-downs provide a gradual reduction in activity to prevent blood
pooling, hasten recovery, and avoid injury. After a workout, take a few minutes to gradually bring
your body back to its normal resting state by slowly decreasing the intensity of your activity. A
few examples of how to cool down after a workout are provided here. After a run, jog slowly and then walk for one to two minutes. Do this while rehydrating to cool
down without allowing the blood to pool in the muscles and reducing blood flow to the heart
and brain. Repeat activities similar to those done in the warm-up to help ease muscle tension and soreness. Flexibility Training. Flexibility is considered to be the maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of motion. Although flexibility is not assessed during the fitness
assessment, it is an important aspect of overall health and should be part of a well-balanced
physical activity routine. Two aspects of flexibility are stability and mobility. Stability deals with
maintaining non-movement functional positions, including postural stability. Mobility deals with
controlled, functional movement through an active range of motion in the various planes of motion. Stretching. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits
gained and may be done easily at home or work. Repetitive movements at work or a more sedentary
job can increase tension in specific muscle groups, which would benefit from mild stretching
during the course of the day. Stretch when the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissue
are warmer (above normal body temperature), and hold stretches for 10 to 30 seconds. Repeat each
stretch three to four times. Ballistic stretching (bouncing) is not recommended. Also, after a
workout, the muscles are warm from activity and should not be over-stretched. Principle of Specificity. Target specific muscle groups or target areas by doing a simple
assessment of functional movement. By incorporating specific moves into a strength training
program, Airmen can improve strength and improve work-related tasks while reducing injuries by
conditioning muscles needed to perform on the job. An Airman whose job requires lifting objects
from the ground and moving them to overhead locations has a work-related task that is equivalent
to the functional movement of a squat and an overhead press with a weight. Principle of Regularity. Exercise routinely to produce a training effect. Establishing a routine of
three workouts per week is best for optimal gains. Airmen should strive for exercising all target
muscle groups at least twice each week. Some Airmen may maintain a moderate level of strength
by doing proper strength workouts once a week for a short period of time after a strong baseline
level of muscular fitness is established. Principle of Recovery. Allow at least a 48-hour recovery period between workouts for the same
muscle groups. A way to do this and maintain an active fitness routine is to train leg muscles with
weights on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and train upper body muscles on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Also, consider recovery times during a workout. The recovery time between
different exercises and sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the workout. Normally, the
recovery time between sets should range from 30 seconds to three minutes. Principle of Balance. When developing a strength training program, remember the importance of
including exercises to work all the major muscle groups – in both the upper and lower body. Also, <!-- Page 424 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

most muscles are organized into opposing pairs; therefore, activating one muscle results in a
pulling motion, while activating the opposing muscle results in the opposite or pushing motion. When planning a training session, one training technique is to follow a pushing exercise with a
pulling exercise resulting in movement at the same joints. For example, following an overhead
press with a lateral pull-down exercise helps ensure good strength balance between opposing
muscle groups which may, in turn, reduce the risk of injury. Principle of Variety. Using different equipment, changing the exercises, and altering the volume
and intensity of workouts are good ways to add variety, and may also produce better results. Periodically substitute different exercises for given muscle groups. Do squats with a barbell instead
of leg presses on a weight machine. Also, for variety or when workout equipment is limited, switch
to partner-resisted exercises or another form of resistance training. <!-- Page 425 -->

### Diet and Nutrition
Airmen are responsible for being mission ready at all times and must recognize that nutrition plays
an important role in maintaining good health and performance. Maintaining a healthy energy
balance is important. Calories from foods and beverages need to be balanced with calories burned
through metabolism and physical activity to meet individual metabolism and weight goals. Estimated calorie needs by age, sex, and physical activity level estimates range from 1,600 to 2,400
calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for adult men. Within each
category, the low end of the range is for sedentary individuals and the high end of the range is for
active individuals. Gradual changes incorporated into a healthy lifestyle are more likely to be
maintained by following the key dietary guideline recommendations for a healthy eating pattern
that account for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. Suggestions for a
healthy eating pattern include a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, proteins, and healthy fats. While not everyone will develop the same diet and nutrition plans, there
are several resources available for establishing healthy, active lifestyles. Initiating and maintaining behavior change in the domains of nutrition and fitness can be difficult. It is helpful to make SMART goals when trying to target these areas (goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely). Examples of SMART nutrition and fitness goals
include: 1) I will exercise (bike or jog at a moderate heartrate) for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, for
one month starting today, and 2) I will reduce my fast food consumption to one (non-supersized)
meal, one time per week, for two months starting today. Note: Maintaining a healthy weight is a
key to health and readiness. An imbalance of calorie intake and lack of physical activity are
primary causes for unintended weight gain and increased potential health risk. Being overweight
or obese increases the risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems, and some cancers. 22.12. Food for Fuel
Snacking and staying hydrated throughout the day can help maintain proper blood sugar levels, particularly during a workout. Carbohydrates can be digested relatively quickly and turned to
energy that can be readily available within 30 to 60 minutes. After a workout, a snack or light meal
may help replenish carbohydrates burned during exercise and convert them into energy storage
(glycogen) for later use. Adding protein to a meal or snack helps rebuild muscle fibers worked
during exercise. Simple healthy snack ideas include low fat yogurt, nuts and dried fruit, string
cheese, and fruit bars. Note: An optimal composition of a post recovery beverage or snack is a
four-to-one carbohydrate to protein ratio. This means that for every four grams of carbohydrates
there should be one gram of protein. As an example, an eight ounce glass of chocolate milk
contains about 29 grams of carbohydrates and eight grams of protein, which serves as a great postrecovery replenishment. 22.13. Micronutrients
Micronutrients include vitamins, minerals, trace elements, amino acids, and other essential
nutrients. They are required in very small amounts for healthy living and are important for our
bodies to function normally. Eating foods rich in micronutrients, such as whole grains and fresh
fruits and vegetables, can promote healthy brain, heart, blood, and metabolism functions. <!-- Page 426 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
426
Micronutrients can also prevent symptoms associated with micronutrient deficiency disorders. 22.14. Macronutrients
Macronutrients make up the bulk of the diet, supply energy, and provide many essential nutrients. Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source used during exercise. An appropriate
amount of carbohydrates is important to maintain glycogen stores for energy reserve. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels and supply energy and provide four calories per
gram. Simple Carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels rapidly rather
than gradually over a longer period of time. Simple carbohydrates are often found in packaged
or processed foods as table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey, fruit drinks, soft drinks, and
candy. Complex Carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels slowly over
a longer period of time, providing a more sustainable source of energy than simple
carbohydrates. Healthy, complex carbohydrates can be found in fruits, breads, cereals, grains, milk, and starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, and squash). An estimated serving size is
about the size of the palm of your hand. The general recommendation for carbohydrates is 4565 percent of total daily caloric intake. Fiber. Fiber can be found in oatmeal, oat bran, nuts and seeds, legumes, whole wheat bread, barley, brown rice, and in most vegetables and fruits. The average American consumes 12-15
grams per day, whereas the recommended total fiber intake is 20-35 grams per day to aid in
digestion and help balance the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. Protein. Proteins are used by our bodies for tissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth
of our muscles. If our body is not getting enough calories from dietary sources or tissue stores, protein may be used for energy. The general recommendation for protein intake is 10-35 percent
of total calories (0.8-1.2 grams per kilograms of body weight) to meet daily needs. Protein can be
found in meats, poultry, fish, legumes, tofu, eggs, nuts, seeds, milk, milk products, and grains. Individuals should focus on lean meats and low-fat milk products to reduce saturated fats. The
recommended serving size of meat is the size of a deck of cards and contains about 21 grams of
protein. Proteins provide four calories per gram. Fats. Fats are a major energy source and help our bodies maintain temperature and protect organs
from trauma. Balanced fat intake is essential to maintain energy reserves. Fats can be found in oils, high fat cuts of meat, baked sweets, whole-fat milk and cream, butter, cheeses, nuts and seeds, avocados, and fish. The general recommendation for fats is 20-35 percent of total calories. Fats
provide nine calories per gram. Trans Fats. Trans fats have been linked to coronary heart disease. Intake of these fats should be
kept as low as possible. They can be found in small amounts in the fatty parts of meat and milk
products and in foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. Trans fats are typically made from
vegetable oils through a process called hydrogenation and are found in foods, such as frozen
pizzas, frozen pies, cookies, margarine spreads, and other processed foods. Saturated Fats. Saturated fats have been linked to coronary heart disease. Saturated fats should
make up less than 10 percent of daily calories. Foods that contain saturated fats are usually solid
at room temperate and can be found in high-fat cheeses, high-fat cuts of meat, whole-fat milk, cream, butter, ice cream, and palm and coconut oils. <!-- Page 427 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
427
Unsaturated Fats. Eating unsaturated fat can reduce your risk for heart disease and improve highdensity lipoprotein (good cholesterol) levels. Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room
temperature and include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats typically
come from plant sources, such as canola oil, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed, and avocado. Unsaturated fats are also present in fish, such as trout, herring, and salmon. 22.15. Sodium
Sodium is a necessary element of our diets; however, high sodium intake raises blood pressure
which is a major risk factor for the nation’s leading cause of death – heart disease. Most diets
include salt in the form of processed or preserved foods, canned foods, soups, cheeses, and deli
meats. On average, Americans consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium every day. The Dietary
Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults limit sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams per day
(about one teaspoon of table salt). Certain “at-risk” groups, including those who have high blood
pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease, should limit their sodium intake to about 1,500 milligrams
per day. The best way to ensure a low sodium diet is to eat whole foods, such as fresh or frozen
fruits and vegetables, lean and unprocessed poultry and fish, unsalted nuts, whole grains, and lowfat dairy products, such as skim milk or yogurt. 22.16. Supplements
Dietary supplements may fall into many categories, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, or other substances that are sold as pills, powders, bars, packs, gels, drinks, or shakes. Be aware that bodybuilding, performance enhancement, and weight loss products most likely
contain undeclared ingredients that may be presented as proprietary blends or delivery systems on
the label. These blends do not specify the amount of each ingredient and increase the risk of
overdosing on ingredients, such as creatine or caffeine. The Food and Drug Administration does
not test supplements before they are sold. Look for third party verification/certification labels
before purchasing supplement products to be sure they have been tested for purity and/or quality. Note: Airmen on flying status must consult with their flight surgeon before taking supplements; however, all Airmen are encouraged to discuss supplement use with their healthcare provider. 22.17. Hydration
The body is made up of about 60 percent water. We need to drink water to maintain the body’s
fluid balance, transport nutrients, regulate body temperature, digest food, and assist many of the
body’s other functions. Consumption requirements differ depending on individual needs, physical
activity, body composition, environmental conditions, and other lifestyle conditions. Generally, a
total daily water consumption (water, beverages, and food) is 2.7 liters per day for women, and 3.7
liters per day for men. Dehydration occurs with fluid losses of greater than two percent of body
weight and increases risk for cognitive and mental performance, heat illness, exhaustion, and
stroke. Exercise substantially increases fluid loss; therefore, hydration before, during, and after
intense workouts is critical. Note: Excess fluid can lead to over-hydration, resulting in symptoms, such as chills, vomiting, dizziness, disorientation, altered mental status, fatigue, headache, and
even death. Try to limit fluids to no more than 6 cups an hour and 48 cups a day. The key with
fluid intake is to replace losses and monitor signs and symptoms of under/over hydration. Sports Drinks. While drinking water is generally best for remaining hydrated, when engaging in
prolonged exercise or physical exertion, a sports drink may be preferred to help replace electrolytes
and carbohydrates. Sports drinks, or carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages that are designed to
hydrate, generally contain a mixture of carbohydrates, sodium, and potassium, which have been
shown to improve exercise performance. <!-- Page 428 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
428
Caffeine. Caffeine does not hydrate. Caffeine is a stimulant present in a variety of products
including coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, dietary supplements, over-the-counter medications, and
some foods. Caffeine used in moderation has been shown to improve cognitive performance in
individuals. A cup of coffee typically has 100 milligrams of caffeine. However, caffeine is of an
acidic nature and can be harmful if consumed in high doses. Consuming large doses of caffeine, roughly 400-500 milligrams at one time, can result in a serious condition known as “caffeine
intoxication” which can lead to nausea, vomiting, agitation, nervousness, headache, electrolyte
imbalances, or worse life-threatening symptoms. Energy Drinks. Energy drinks are not meant to hydrate. The effect of energy drinks on athletic
performance is inconsistent. One thing you will find with energy drinks are warnings due to the
use of stimulants, such as caffeine, green tea extract, guarana seed extract, yerba mate, acacia
rigidula, taurine, ginseng, or other proprietary energy boost blends. Proprietary blends can contain
novel, untested ingredients, along with botanicals, amino acids, proteins, peptides, or extracts. Additionally, vitamins and minerals may be added, leading to excessive intakes. The safest
solution for hydration is to avoid energy supplements and learn more about electrolytes and
carbohydrate fueling strategies to decide which sport drink (not energy drink) is the best choice. Alcohol. Alcohol does not hydrate. Anything in excess is not a good idea, particularly for alcohol. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise limiting alcohol to one drink per day for women and
two drinks per day for men. The serving size for beer is 12 ounces, wine is five ounces, and 80
proof distilled spirits is 1.5 ounces. The average serving of alcohol generally has about 150
calories and can be a significant contributor to caloric consumption in the diet, with no nutritional
value. Always exercise good judgment when consuming alcohol, whether or not otherwise
restricted by public law or military directive. Alcohol may lead to excess weight gain, increased
risk for chronic diseases, osteoporosis, stress injuries, and impaired short- and long-term cognitive
function. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can be harmful to your health and may increase
the risk for high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, and several forms of cancer. <!-- Page 429 -->

### Tobacco-Free Force
The USAF goal is to have a tobacco-free force. Optimal health and total fitness are force
multipliers and critical to our military mission. Tobacco use includes all products that may be
configured to deliver nicotine, including but not limited to cigars, cigarettes, electronic
cigarettes/vape pens, stem pipes, water pipes, hookahs, vaporizers, smokeless products, and any
other nicotine delivery system defined as a tobacco product. Using tobacco products is nonconducive to promoting mission readiness and productivity and is inconsistent with the USAF’s
goal of a mission-ready, healthy, and fit force. The significant costs associated with tobacco use are both physical and financial. TRICARE has
estimated that tobacco use costs the Department of Defense $1.7 billion annually because of
increased healthcare utilization and decreased work productivity due to smoke breaks and
illnesses. No less significant is the fact that the cost of smoking a pack a day for a year is onemonth’s base pay for an Airman Basic. 22.19. Tobacco Restrictions
AFI 48-104, Tobacco Free Living, describes designated tobacco use areas and restrictions for
tobacco products on USAF installations. Commanders and leaders shall minimize the number of
designated tobacco use areas to as close to zero as possible. Installation minimum distances are
at least 50 feet from building entrances, and air intake ducts. The minimum distance from
playgrounds is at least 100 feet. The USAF prohibits all students in technical training, inresidence professional military education, accession, and graduate medical education programs
from using tobacco products while in uniform, and prohibits tobacco use at all times during basic
military training. 22.20. Health Risks of Tobacco Use
Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. Tobacco smoke is a Class “A” carcinogen and is estimated to cause 480,000 deaths per year, of
which, approximately 41,000 are from secondhand smoke exposure. Smokeless tobacco contains
## different cancer-causing agents (carcinogens). Oral cancers from tobacco products affect
30,000 people annually, and one person dies every hour because of this disease. Only 50 percent
of persons are alive at five years after diagnosis. In addition to several forms of cancer and
cardiovascular disease, tobacco use affects all bodily systems. Tobacco use decreases endurance, night vision, and fine motor coordination (the coordination needed to hold a weapon steady). And
tobacco use increases the risk of injuries (such as fractures), poses post-operative respiratory
complications, and impairs (or slows) wound healing. Estimates show smoking increases the risk
for coronary heart disease and stroke by two to four times, and for men and women developing
lung cancer by approximately 25 times. 22.21. Tobacco Cessation
Nicotine found in tobacco products is addictive. Seven out of 10 smokers in the United States have
indicated that they want to completely quit smoking, and nearly one-half have tried to quit in the
past year. Some studies suggest that it may take some people up to 30 tries before successfully
quitting smoking, others suggest that once you’ve made the conscious decision to quit, and you no
<!-- Page 430 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
430
longer consider yourself a smoker, tobacco user, or dipper, you change your lifestyle and kick the
habit, regardless of temptation. Commanders are expected to support Airmen trying to quit tobacco
products. Installation health promotion programs provide strategies for education, motivation, and
intervention to discourage tobacco use. Formal, structured tobacco cessation programs designed
to assist members in breaking the addiction to tobacco products are available as well. State
telephone-based tobacco cessation quit lines can be reached at no-cost by U.S. residents of each
state, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico at 1-800-QUIT-NOW. 22.22. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program
The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program is designed to promote
readiness, health, and wellness through the prevention and treatment of substance misuse and
abuse. Participation in ADAPT may serve to minimize the negative consequences of substance
misuse and abuse to the individual, family, and organization; provide comprehensive education
and treatment to individuals who experience problems attributed to substance misuse or abuse; and
restore function and return identified substance abusers to unrestricted duty status or assist them
in their transition to civilian life. Note: To ensure military readiness, the ingestion of products
containing or derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil, including but not limited to delta-8tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), is prohibited. Products made with
hemp seed, hemp seed oil, and CBD may contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, an active
ingredient of marijuana, which is detectable through USAF drug testing. Failure by military
personnel to comply with the prohibition on the ingestion of products containing, or products
derived from, hemp seed or hemp seed oil and CBD, is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of
Military Justice. 22.23. Leadership Responsibilities
Signs and symptoms of substance use and misuse may exist. If signs do exist, talk with the
individual to determine if professional assistance is needed. Document and discuss specific
instances of unusual behavior or acknowledgement of a substance use problem with the supervisor, first sergeant, or unit commander to help expedite care, as needed. The responsibility to diagnose
a substance us disorder lies with ADAPT personnel. Identifying individuals who may need treatment is a critical first step in helping them break free
of the tremendously potent cycle of denial, negativity, and increased substance use; however, entering treatment is only a first step. A member’s substance use problem did not develop
overnight, and treatment and recovery will likely take time. The treatment team, consisting of the
commander, supervisor, member’s counselor, medical consultants, other appropriate helping
agencies, and the member, provide continued support throughout treatment. Supervisors remain
focused on the member’s duty performance, attendance in the program, and maintenance of
standards. Commander, first sergeant, and supervisor involvement in the treatment team, and
meeting at key points in the patient’s treatment and recovery, are important. The commander or
first sergeant and the supervisor must be involved at program entry, termination, and anytime
there are significant treatment difficulties. The primary objective of the treatment team is to guide
the clinical course of the treatment after examining all the facts. Note: All RegAF members
involved in alcohol- related misconduct will be referred for a substance use assessment. 22.24. Substance Use Assessment and Treatment
The central purpose of the substance use assessment is to determine the patient’s need for treatment
and level of care required. ADAPT program managers conduct required reviews of medical
records and all documentation within seven calendar days of notification to determine diagnosis, <!-- Page 431 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
431
treatment planning, and delivery of substance use services. Substance use treatment is divided into
two services: nonclinical and clinical. Nonclinical Services. Members who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder
will receive targeted prevention and education services tailored to the individual based on a
thorough assessment and determination of risk. Follow-up appointments and review will be
conducted to reassess the need for continued services. Additional counseling addressing biopsychosocial issues identified in the assessment may be prescribed. Length of involvement will be
determined based on the patient’s presenting problems and agreed-upon services or behavioral
contract. Individuals being processed for separation are provided appropriate medical care
(including but not limited to detoxification) prior to separation. Separation action is not postponed
because of a member’s participation in ADAPT. Clinical Services. Those who meet the diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder will be
entered into substance use treatment with the level and intensity of care determined by the ADAPT
program manager. Depending on the member’s needs, variable lengths of stay or duration of
treatment are provided within an array of treatment settings that reflect a multidisciplinary
approach to assist the patient to achieve full recovery, free of the negative effects of substance use. To the greatest extent possible, patient detoxification will be managed on an outpatient basis. Individuals assessed as requiring medically managed (inpatient) detoxification will be entered into
an appropriate medical facility. Family involvement is strongly encouraged. Note: Individuals
diagnosed with a substance use disorder will refrain from the use of alcohol during the initial phase
of treatment and are strongly encouraged to continue to abstain during aftercare. Involvement in
self-help recovery groups is encouraged as an adjunct to treatment. The frequency of attendance
is determined by the treatment team with the patient. Successful Completion. Patients will not be considered to have successfully completed treatment
until the patient has completed treatment and continuing care (aftercare). Based on Veterans
Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Substance Use
Disorders, current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and American
Society of Addiction Medicine criteria, the treatment team determines patient progress toward
agreed-upon goals and issues as stated in the treatment plan and determines when the patient is
effectively in recovery and no longer requires program resources. Failing the Program. The treatment team may determine failure of a patient’s participation in the
program based on a demonstrated pattern of unacceptable behavior; inability or unwillingness to
comply with their treatment plan; or involvement in alcohol or drug-related incidents after
receiving initial treatment. An individual who has failed ADAPT will be considered for
administrative separation by his or her commander. Decisions regarding aftercare services will be
based on a current assessment of status and will include establishment of an aftercare treatment
plan identifying specific goals, interventions, and means to assess interventions. 22.25. Management of Personnel with Substance use Disorders
The commander is responsible for all personnel and administrative actions pertaining to patients
involved in ADAPT, to include assignment availability, promotion eligibility, reenlistment
eligibility, personnel reliability program, and security clearance. Application of administrative
restrictions should be based on the establishment of an unfavorable information file or control
roster resulting from the member’s unacceptable behavior, and not solely based on their
involvement in ADAPT. The Line of Duty Determination. A member’s substance use misconduct can lead to a line of
duty determination. A line of duty determination is a finding made after an investigation into the
<!-- Page 432 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
432
circumstances of a member’s illness, injury, disease, or death. The line of duty determination
protects the interests of both the member and the U.S. Government. The finding concludes: (1)
whether or not the illness, injury, or disease existed prior to service, and if an existed prior to
service condition was aggravated by military service; (2) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent without authority; and (3) whether or not the
illness, injury, disease, or death was due to the member’s misconduct. A line of duty determination
may impact disability retirement and severance pay, forfeiture of pay, period of enlistment, as well
as veteran benefits. Additional guidance may be found in DAFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (LOD)
Determination, Medical Continuation (MEDCON), and Incapacitation (INCAP) Pay. Medical Care Referrals. Medical personnel must notify the unit commander and the ADAPT
program manager when a member is observed, identified, or suspected as being under the influence
of drugs or alcohol while seeking medical care; receives treatment for an injury or illness that may
be the result of substance use; is suspected of abusing substances; or is admitted as a patient for
alcohol or drug detoxification. <!-- Page 433 -->

### Mental Preparedness
One of the telltale signs of a military professional is preparation. When the time comes to use the
skills we’ve learned, military professionals are ready. Most experience is gained by accepting
opportunities as they come, even when conditions are not perfect. Through experience, professionals build the confidence, judgment, courage, and integrity needed to continue
developing professionally. The USAF is committed to taking care of Airmen and families and has
a wide-range of support capabilities available to address issues and take care of the Total Force. Despite how ready we may feel, demands of the mission can sometimes increase stressors affecting
well-being and resiliency. 22.27. Psychological First Aid
Psychological first aid is a way of reducing initial and ongoing stress by developing adaptive
coping and recovery skills. Airmen who take care of themselves by getting adequate sleep, eating
a balanced diet, and making time for rest and relaxation, combined with the use of positive stress
management skills, can reduce actual and perceived stress in their lives. Whether deployed or in
garrison, we all need a place to reset and recharge. Consider the following aspects of coping with
stress, for yourself and for others. Have a physically and emotionally safe place to recuperate or to relax. Know (or be) someone who understands, listens, and is compassionate. Find opportunities to connect with others while at the gym, dining facility, or local events. Provide or demonstrate coping skills that empower others to return to ‘normal’ state. Seek supportive services, such as religious affairs, first sergeants, or mental health providers. Contact Military and Family Life Counselors for counseling and supportive services. 22.28. Mental Strength and Resilience
All people experience stressors (challenges or problems) and distress (negative feelings associated
with stressors). Long workdays, increased deployments, and financial issues are just a few of the
conditions that cause stress. The frequency of stress and the significant negative effect stress can
have on people and organizations make this a major concern for Airmen at all levels. As an
organizational concern, stress can negatively affect performance, organizational effectiveness, and
mission accomplishment. As a personal concern, experiencing stress over an extended period of
time can lead to health problems and affect overall quality of life. Therefore, it is important to
personally and professionally recognize stress and learn how to manage it effectively. 22.29. Stress Reactions
For Airmen today, stressors occur within the work environment as well as outside the work
environment, often involving family, relationship, and financial issues. We know when we feel
stressed, but recognizing some of the key signs of stress can help deal with issues before they
evolve into bigger problems. Stress reactions typically appear in four different categories: cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical. Reactions associated with these categories are
provided here so they may be recognized and addressed early by minimizing, adjusting, or
<!-- Page 434 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
successfully coping with the cause. 434
Cognitive Stress. Cognitive stress can manifest as memory problems, an inability to concentrate, poor judgment, seeing only the negative, anxious, or racing thoughts, or constant worrying. Emotional Stress. Emotional stress can manifest as apathy, anxiety, depression, irritability, job
dissatisfaction, memory problems, or mental fatigue. Behavioral Stress. Behavioral stress can manifest as appetite changes, increased arguments, increased smoking, neglecting self-care, social withdrawal, substance abuse, or violence. Physical Stress. Physical stress can manifest as frequent illness, headaches, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, physical exhaustion, sleep disturbances, or weight gain or loss. 22.30. Individual Stress Management
The key to recognizing stress is knowing what feels normal so you can recognize when something
feels off. The earlier stress can be identified, the earlier stress reduction techniques can be applied. Each of the following steps can help in developing a well-rounded stress management plan. Make Adjustments. Reduce stress by identifying potential stressors before they arise. For
example, if you are stressed by crowds and long lines, adjust your plans so that you may minimize
the exposure to crowded environments. While planning can’t prevent all stress, it is extremely
valuable in minimizing or preparing for exposure to stress before a stressor occurs. Time Management. Not having enough time to complete a task can be a significant stressor for
some people. If time management is an issue, reduce stress by using effective time management
skills and tools, like developing a task list and prioritizing tasks. Overload Avoidance. For most people to eliminate or reduce the effects of overload-related
stressors is relatively simple. For a start, identify and avoid busy work, delegate, or empower others, when possible, learn to say no, and attempt to negotiate unreasonable deadlines. Relaxation. Relaxation can help manage stress and help you stay alert, energetic, and productive. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, reading, and listening to music can improve your heart
rate, regulate your blood pressure, and decrease your respiratory rate. By incorporating relaxation
skills into your daily routines, you can train your body to respond differently to stress. Exercise and Nutrition. Regular exercise combined with a healthy diet is an effective stress
management technique. Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy and tension caused by
stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures your body has the nutrients needed to manage stress and
helps prevent overeating. Exercising and eating a balanced diet help your body become more
resistant to the negative results of stress, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and frequent
illness. Social Support. Having a strong social support network, such as family, friends, social groups, and peers, can help manage stress. Being able to discuss problems with people who care about you
and your well-being can help reduce stress by providing a more positive outlook, suggesting
solutions to your problems, or just listening. Prioritize. On the job, identify potential sources of stress, determine the importance of each task, and eliminate tasks that are not necessary or productive. If a job requires long hours, consider using
elements of job enrichment, like adequate time off or periodic breaks to help reduce potential
stress. If possible, restructure the job to accommodate individual needs to help reduce stress and
enhance productivity. <!-- Page 435 -->

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can occur after someone
has gone through a traumatic event, such as war-related combat, sexual or physical assault, or a
natural or man-made disaster. The USAF strongly encourages Airmen to seek treatment early or
encourages early intervention. Because this disorder impacts not only the person who suffers from
it, but those who are close to them, it is important for all military members to be educated about
PTSD. With enhanced awareness, many people may be prevented from developing this condition, and those who suffer from PTSD may receive treatment before symptoms become disabling and
chronic. Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Symptoms of PTSD include: (1) intrusive or
unwanted thoughts, such as distressing memories, nightmares, or flashbacks; (2) avoidance
behavior in the form of efforts to avoid reminders of the traumatic event; (3) negative thoughts
and moods, such as feeling disconnected from others or believing that the world is a dangerous
place; and (4) hyper-arousal symptoms, including difficulty sleeping and irritability. Approximately seven to eight percent of the United States population will have PTSD at some
point during their lives. Fortunately, within the last decade researchers have developed highly
effective treatments that can lead to symptom reduction and even loss of the diagnosis of PTSD. Helpful Actions to Take. Knowing how to respond to someone with an invisible wound, such as
PTSD, is challenging because there is so much going on inside the individual that is not visible on
the outside. Some of their behaviors or moods may make you feel uncomfortable, confused, or
even annoyed. However, it is important to remember that a person with PTSD may be so distracted
by painful thoughts, memories, or physical injuries, that they are not fully able to focus and
concentrate as well as they would like to. A great way to determine how to respond to a person with an invisible wound is to put yourself in
their shoes, to practice empathy: Try to imagine how you would feel in their situation, even if you don’t know all of the details
of what they’ve experienced. Remind yourself and those around you of the sacrifice that has been made in service of our
country. Don’t be afraid to ask about what is going on. Give yourself permission to intervene if you think
they need help and make the time to have a sincere conversation with them. Question starters
to help you talk about this topic are: “What’s going on in your life? I’ve noticed you seem upset.” “I’m concerned about you. Can we talk about it?”
“Is there something I can do to help you?” “What do you think might help?”
Once you’ve asked a question, allow time and space for the answer. Encourage them to share
without fear of judgment or interruption. Listening shows you care, will help you understand, and builds rapport. Acknowledge the distress. It is not helpful to tell them they shouldn’t feel a certain way. PTSD
is a real condition that produces measurable changes in brain function. Acknowledging distress
is a key step in dispelling myths about invisible wounds and removing the stigma associated
with getting help. Discuss needs and offer to help make a plan to address them. Often, this means suggesting a
helping resource. Offering to accompany them can be a good way to make getting help seem

less difficult. Additional training on how to interact with Airmen with invisible wounds, such as PTSD, can be
found in the invisible wounds videos located at the Department of the Air Force Resilience
website (https://www.resilience.af.mil/). 22.32. Redeployment, Recovery, and Reconstitution
Deploying Airmen receive just-in-time training on stress reactions, psychological first aid, and
referral resources through pre-deployment mental health training. While preparation, deployment, and post-deployment support are all important, receiving continued support upon return from
deployment is an emphasized aspect of readiness. The intent of the ongoing redeployment support
process is to provide continuous, integrated support from the deployed area to home station while
assisting with the transition from the deployed environment to family life and worksite. Taking
leave after arduous duty and deployment can have a beneficial effect on an individual’s
psychological and physical status, and an immediate recovery period allows returning Airmen to
tend to personal needs neglected during lengthy periods away from home. Sometimes readjustment
from deployment requires participation in structured recovery time and activities for members and
families prior to leave. The redeployment support timeline identifies activities at the critical
redeployment, recovery, reintegration, and reconstitution junctures. 22.33. Psychological Services
Mental health services are designed to strengthen the readiness capability of the force and ensure
Airmen are equipped for peak performance. Seeking care for a mental health problem is a sign of
strength, not a sign of weakness. Seeking help early increases the likelihood of recovery and
reduces risk for subsequent negative consequences of mental health symptoms. More than 12
percent of USAF personnel voluntarily seek mental health services each year. Willingness to seek
help when needed is a sign of good self-awareness and judgment. The fear of having a negative
impact on one’s career for seeking care at the mental health clinic is diminishing across the USAF. Time has proven that seeking help appropriately often does not have a long-term negative career
impact. In fact, seeking help can improve performance and enable people to better solve problems. In many cases, seeking mental health treatment early can actually save one’s USAF career. 22.34. USAF Suicide Prevention Program
When suicides occur in the USAF, they result in a number of serious consequences: the loss of
human life; grief and loss to the deceased’s family, friends, co-workers, and military community; and a direct impact on mission capability through loss of the deceased’s skills, experience, and
productivity. While suicide prevention is the responsibility of every Airman, the USAF has
identified that leadership support and action across all levels of command are critical to the goal
of reducing suicide in the USAF. Military and civilian leaders will build an environment that
promotes healthy and adaptive behaviors, fosters the wingman culture, and encourages responsible
help-seeking actions of all Airmen. Note: In an effort to promote help-seeking actions by Airmen
who are experiencing legal or administrative problems, the USAF instituted the Limited Privilege
Suicide Prevention Program in accordance with AFI 44-172, Mental Health, which provided an
added layer of confidentiality that allows Airmen who are under investigation to receive mental
health care without the risk of information disclosed during treatment being used to incriminate
them in the future. This is important since Airmen who are under investigation for legal problems
are at significantly elevated risk for suicide and other negative outcomes. Mental health providers
are required by DoDI 6490.08, Command Notification Requirements to Dispel Stigma in
Providing Mental Health Care to Service Members, to disclose safety (suicidal or violent thoughts

or self-injurious behavior) and fitness for duty issues to commanders, but all other information is
confidential. 22.35. Recognition
Airmen must know the importance of recognizing that anyone can become suicidal, regardless of
how well they have previously managed military or personal stress. Warning signs can be sudden, may signify a person is in distress, and require immediate support. Sudden changes, such as sleep
difficulties or discipline problems, may be warning signs. Those most likely to spot a person at
risk for suicide are the ones with whom an individual interacts on a daily basis (friends, coworkers, and immediate supervisors). These individuals are best positioned to notice changes in behavior, mood, or performance. If you hear someone comment or indicate they’re considering suicide, take
it seriously, get involved, and get them the help they need. Even if there appears to be no real
indication of a serious problem, be observant for any sudden changes in behavior or attitude that
could be a sign that they need help. Find out what caused the observed changes, assist in choosing
resources to resolve stressors, and communicate concerns with the chain of command, as
appropriate. Leaders and Airmen of all ranks have a vested interest in knowing the people they work with, investing in their professional and personal development, and quickly addressing issues whenever
they arise. The following actions can be taken to support and help resolve life’s challenges and
reduce the number of suicides: (1) know co-workers, their usual moods and behaviors, and how
they are functioning; (2) be able to recognize early signs of risk, stress, and distress; (3) engage
with Airmen to determine what may be stressful or problematic; (4) assist Airmen with choosing
the most appropriate resource to help resolve the problem; and (5) follow-up with Airmen to ensure
the stressors are resolving and new ones are not taking their place. Risk Factors. Risk factors for suicide can include, but are not limited to relationship difficulties, problems at work, legal and financial problems, mental health diagnosis, substance misuse, and
previous suicide attempts. Some factors leaders should watch for and address to ensure effective
supervision and open communication exist in the organization are: (1) tunnel vision on the mission; (2) not engaging with Airmen; (3) difficulty recognizing risk factors and warning signs; (4) lack
of knowledge of USAF supported resources and the true impact of seeking help on a USAF career; and (5) inappropriately sheltering Airmen from the consequences of their actions or failing to take
proper action. Protective Factors. Protective factors include social support, connectedness, sense of belonging, sense of purpose, effective individual coping skills, and cultural norms that promote and protect
responsible help-seeking behavior. 22.36. Ask, Care, and Escort Model
Suicide prevention is everyone’s responsibility. The Ask, Care, and Escort (ACE) Model was
developed to assist Airmen in intervening when an Airman experiences stress, distress, or faces
challenges. Understanding the appropriate steps to suicide risk prevention and the available USAF
approved resources can aid in saving the career and life of a fellow Airman. The acronym ACE is
one that people can easily remember. Ask. When you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or are aware of risk
factors in someone’s life, ask questions to learn more about the person’s situation. If you have any
uncertainty about someone’s safety, calmly but directly ask the question, “Are you thinking of
killing/hurting yourself?” Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk about a subject that
may otherwise be difficult to bring up. It lets the Airman know you are ready to discuss what they
<!-- Page 438 -->

438
are experiencing. Do not promise to keep thoughts of suicide a secret. Airmen need to remember
the importance of sharing these concerns with leaders and professionals who can help. Care. Showing care and concern for those at risk is important. Simply taking the time to ask about
problems, and asking specifically about suicide, shows caring and concern. If someone
acknowledges thoughts of suicide, listen, and allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid
making judgmental statements, immediately trying to solve their problem, or trying to talk them
out of suicide. If they share thoughts of suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to
their concerns, and begin getting them help. Determine if they have a plan for suicide, what the
plan is, and take reasonable steps to secure the potential means of suicide, but do not put yourself
in harm’s way. Airmen in distress who are seeking access to lethal means, such as a firearm, should
be considered at risk for self-harm. If you are not able to secure the potential means of self-harm, or you have significant concern about the individual’s safety, then contact command and
emergency services. Building time and space between Airmen in distress and access to lethal
means (including firearms and medications) can reduce the risk of suicide attempts and deaths. Escort. After asking about suicide and showing concern, the final step is to escort the person to
command or professional support that can provide appropriate assistance. Do not leave the person
in distress alone. At most bases, professionals are on call through the command post, and
evaluations can be conducted in local emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If a
distressed Airman will not agree to go with you and you have significant concern about the
individual’s safety you should contact your chain of command, contact emergency services; local, civilian, or national resources; dial 911; go to the emergency room or mental health clinic; or call
the Veterans Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255). The most important step is to get the individual the
help they need if they are in distress. 22.37. Comprehensive Airman Fitness
Comprehensive Airman Fitness (CAF) is a holistic approach to build and sustain a thriving and
resilient USAF Community by taking care of each other and ourselves through wellness in four
domains – mental, physical, social, and spiritual. The intent is to equip Airmen and families with
the tools and skills needed to continually assess and adjust to the unique challenges of a military
lifestyle. The Wingman concept is a core element of CAF essential to building fit, resilient, and
ready Airmen by dedicating time to focus on individual and unit wellness and fostering a culture
of Airmen taking care of Airmen. Mental Domain. The mental domain is defined as the ability to effectively cope with unique
mental stressors and challenges needed to ensure mission readiness. The tenets of the mental
domain are awareness, adaptability, positive thinking, and decision-making. Physical Domain. The physical domain is defined as the ability to adopt and sustain healthy
behaviors needed to enhance health and wellness. The tenets of the physical domain are
endurance, strength, nutrition, and recovery. Social Domain. The social domain is defined as the ability to engage in healthy social networks
that promote overall well-being and optimal performance. The tenets of the social domain are
connectedness, teamwork, social support, and communication. Spiritual Domain. The spiritual domain is defined as the ability to strengthen a set of beliefs, principles, or values that sustain an individual’s sense of well-being and purpose. The tenets of the
spiritual domain are purpose, core values, perseverance, and perspective. Additional information, tools, and programs designed to strengthen individual and unit CAF can
be found by visiting the Department of the Air Force Resilience website. <!-- Page 439 -->

The military health system supports all uniformed service personnel, retirees, and their families. It
provides the direction, resources, health care providers, and other means necessary for promoting
the health of the beneficiary population. Military health support includes developing and
promoting health awareness
to educate customers, discovering, and resolving
environmentally based health threats, providing health services (including preventive care, problem intervention services, pastoral care, and religious support), and improving the means and
methods for maintaining the health of the beneficiary population by constantly evaluating the
performance of the health support. Army, Navy, and USAF medical professionals help ensure
those in uniform are medically ready to deploy anywhere around the globe on a moment's notice. These medical professionals not only send service members on their way, they’re with them. issues
Defense Health Agency. The Defense Health Agency is a joint, integrated combat support agency
within the military health system that enables the Army, Navy, and USAF medical services to
provide a medically ready force and ready medical force to CCMDs in both peacetime and
wartime. The Defense Health Agency supports the delivery of integrated, affordable, and highquality health services to military health system beneficiaries and is responsible for driving greater
integration of clinical and business processes across the military health system. 22.40. Air Force Medical Service
Specifically, the Air Force Medical Service’s mission is to enable medically fit forces, provide
expeditionary medics, and improve the health of all who serve to meet our nation’s needs. The
Air Force Medical Service’s vision is to ensure that patients are the “Healthiest and Highest
Performing Segment of the United States by 2025.” The service’s four primary objectives are: promote and sustain a healthy and fit force, prevent illness and injury, restore health, and optimize
human performance. It is increasingly called upon to deliver medical capabilities throughout the
range of military operations, consisting of civil-military operations, global health engagement, or
humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, as part of joint or multinational operations.
