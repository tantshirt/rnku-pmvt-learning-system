### Team Building
Dynamic is a way of describing elements of a process or system; it is a term used to recognize
constant change, activity, or progress. Dynamic can also be used to describe a force that stimulates
change or progress. As Airmen, we must know and understand our leaders, peers, and
subordinates. In team environments, we must know the right approaches to building effective
teams and cultivating a healthy, dynamic team spirit. The spirit in which a team operates will
influence every stage of team development and can ultimately determine whether goals are met. Healthy teams are high performing teams that most often have a foundation of trust, communication, and cooperation. While each is essential in building a healthy team spirit, trust is
at the core of all healthy team interaction. Team members must feel comfortable with, and
confident in, one another to be able to fully participate. Positive group member behavior is
essential for a team to accomplish its goals. Team members usually take some time to form strong
bonds for trust, communication, and cooperation. There are typically stages that teams experience
before rising to the level of becoming highly functional, productive teams. Trust. Effective teamwork requires a high degree of trust. Team members must share mutual
confidence in the integrity and ability of teammates. They also need to feel comfortable enough to
take risks, think outside the box, and share their thoughts and ideas without fear of being shut down
or discounted. Freedom to communicate openly, honestly, and directly within the group is the
hallmark of a trust-based team. Individuals must understand the importance of utilizing effective
communication skills to develop the level of trust needed for the teams to grow. “Nothing reduces trust in a group faster than members saying one thing within
the group and something else outside the group. When members are assertive enough
to say what they need to say directly to the appropriate people and to refrain from
talking behind each other’s backs, trust is enhanced.”
Suzanne Zoglio
Teams at Work
Creating trust among team members requires professional working relationships, professional
behavior, and a desire to achieve established objectives. Dialogue and feedback must be
exchanged between members in an open and sincere manner without fear of harsh criticism. Team
members should respond to one another with receptivity to inputs, and information sharing. It’s
true…there’s honesty and then there’s brutal honesty. Feedback, critical thinking, and
disagreements can be exchanged among team members without being brutally honest or
offensive. Leaders can promote a trusting atmosphere by encouraging open and honest
communication. Leaders empower their teams to solve problems innovatively through a shared
sense of collaboration that is free of selfish goals. Leaders should focus their efforts on setting the
right tone for developing trusting relationships, communicating openly and honestly, knowing, and establishing a good rapport with team members, and discouraging cliques or divisions within
the team. In other words, team leaders should set the example and lead by example. <!-- Page 261 -->

Communication. Teams must communicate. Team members need to safely assert themselves
and share their ideas. Teams that don’t allow honest, open sharing quickly lose their effectiveness. As a result, some team members may purposely withhold vital information or disengage from the
team. This may cause confusion, frustration, and the inability to complete tasks within teams. While sharing information between team members is essential in producing effective, well
thought out plans, leaders must be willing to share information with team members. When leaders
hold on to information, they can create an inaccurate, incomplete, or totally wrong picture of the
expected outcome to team members. Information sharing yields better results. Leaders can
increase team success by giving members complete access to all necessary data, discouraging the
discounting of ideas and feelings, and encouraging the practice of active listening. Cooperation. Cooperation is critical if teams are to combine skills and approaches to meet the
challenges, customer requirements, and mission changes. Cooperation yields synergistic results
and reduces the exerted effort it takes to reach a desired outcome. Leaders who encourage
cooperation show team members that others have very important contributions to the goals of the
team. Team members may also come to understand how dependent they are on one another in
reaching mission objectives. Successful teams have few turf wars, little competitiveness, and an
ability to forgive and forget. Cooperation breeds shared ownership for performance results, and
achieving objectives increases team pride and team spirit. A sign that a team is not performing
cohesively is when unhelpful competition exists among team members. This may be observed
when some team members attempt to outshine others to gain extra attention or credibility. When
a member of a team demonstrates “all-starring” behavior, they may be experiencing a power
struggle. To reduce power-play behavior, leaders should reemphasize each team member’s
specific roles and responsibilities, which eliminates potential barriers to cooperation. 14.2. Stages of Team Building
The typical stages or team dynamics that groups or teams experience are normal and often
inevitable. The four stages most often experienced by teams are: forming, storming, norming, and
performing. Forming. Forming is the initial period of uncertainty in which individuals try to determine their
place on a team and establish or accept the procedures and rules of the team. When a team is
forming, members cautiously explore the boundaries of acceptable group behavior in various
ways. The forming stage is when the transition from individual to member status occurs and when
a leader’s guidance may be tested, both formally and informally. Storming. During the storming stage, conflicts begin to arise as members tend to resist the
influence of the team and rebel against accomplishing the task. Storming is probably the most
difficult stage when some team members begin to realize the task is different and more difficult
than they initially expected. Impatient about the lack of progress, but still too inexperienced to
know much about decision-making or the scientific approach, members argue about just what
actions the team should take. Team members may try to rely solely on their personal experience, thus avoiding the need for collaboration with other team members. Regardless of tensions, during
the storming stage, team members are beginning to understand one another. Norming. During the norming stage, team members establish cohesiveness and commitment, discovering new ways of working together and setting norms for appropriate behavior. During the
norming stage, members reconcile competing loyalties and responsibilities and begin to accept the
team, team ground rules (norms), and their roles in the team, and the individuality of fellow
members. Emotional conflict is reduced as competitive relationships become more cooperative. As the team begins to work out their differences, they focus more time and energy on the team
<!-- Page 262 -->

262
objective. Performing. In the performing stage, the team develops proficiency in achieving its goals and
becomes more flexible in its patterns of working together. By the performing stage, the team has
settled its relationships and expectations and can begin diagnosing and solving problems and
choosing and implementing changes. At last, team members have discovered and accepted each
other’s strengths and weaknesses and learned and embraced their roles. In the performing stage, the team can be considered to be an effective, cohesive, and productive unit. 14.3. Conflict Management
Conflict is inevitable in every organization and is often necessary to reach high levels of
performance. Conflict involves differences between parties that result in interference or
opposition. Such differences can cause positive change or can decrease productivity. Positive
conflict results in addressing problems for a solution, greater understanding, and enhanced
communication between individuals or groups. Conflict can be constructive when managed
effectively. Conflict becomes destructive when it results in barriers to cooperation and
communication, thus degrading morale and diverting attention from tasks. At times, managers
tend to avoid conflict because of possible negative repercussions; however, managing conflict
effectively benefits the organization by reducing ambiguity and stimulating productivity by
constructively looking at alternatives. 14.4. Sources of Conflict
Conflict is defined as extended struggle or disagreement. This can lead to frustration of an
important concern, whether real or perceived. Many factors may result in or increase the
probability of conflict within an organization. These factors manifest themselves in combination
with other factors, making it potentially difficult to identify the specific source of the conflict. Conflict often originates with one or more of the following situations. Communication Factors. Communication often gets the blame for problems that occur in the
workplace; however, the real crux of the problem is more likely to be miscommunication. For
example, communication or even over-communication may occur within an organization, and
when the communication is misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete it can lead to frustration and
stress. For personnel to perform at their very best, they need constructive, understandable, and
accurate information. Structural Factors. The larger the organization, the more people there will be to potentially cause
and participate in conflict. Resources, whether scarce or under high demand, may generate
conflict as parties posture to compete for the resources. The more people interact, the more
noticeable their differences become. When dealing with line-staff distinctions, this can lead to
disputes, partly because although people may attempt to participate, it does not necessarily mean
their contributions are heard, valued, or accepted. Leaders should encourage employees to
challenge the status quo, seek better ways of doing business, and continually improve processes. Also, rewards programs can potentially encourage and develop a healthy competition as long as
the rewards aren’t perceived as unfair, unjust, or biased in some way. Personal Behavior Factors. Conflict can arise because of individual differences, such as goals
and objectives, perceptions, values, and personalities. If we align our personal needs and values
with the overall USAF mission, we will be more aptly willing to change, set aside self-interests, listen to the ideas of others, and reduce conflict. Although not always easy, striving to align
personal values with USAF values can reduce conflict that arises based on differences that exist
in the workplace. Addressing issues through a realistic or even positive perspective rather than
<!-- Page 263 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
263
being based on emotion will lead to fewer arguments and more professionally driven
performance. Personality conflicts and differences among employees will always exist, but the
way we respond to them does not have to be unprofessional or disruptive to the organization. 14.5. Conflict Management Techniques
There are a few techniques that can be used to minimize the impact that workplace conflict can
have on individuals and on the organization. When considering the degree of cooperation, and the
degree of assertiveness of those involved, leaders can determine how to categorize conflict and
how to best manage it. Cooperation refers to how willing a person or group is to satisfy the other’s
needs. Assertiveness refers to how active a person is in addressing the conflict. Using an approach
addressed by Dr. Kenneth Thomas, author of Conflict and Negotiation Processes in
Organizations, there are five major conflict management styles and categories, defined based on
the levels of cooperation and assertiveness associated with any given situation. Competing (Forcing). (High assertiveness and low cooperativeness). The competing (forcing)
style attempts to overwhelm an opponent with formal authority, threats, or the use of power. Collaborating. (High assertiveness and high cooperativeness). The collaborating style uses an
attempt to satisfy the concerns of both sides through honest discussion. Creative approaches to
conflict reduction, such as sharing resources, may actually lead to both parties being materially
better off. For the collaborating style to be successful, trust and openness are required of all
participants. Collaborating involves behavior that seeks a ‘win’ position for both groups. Accommodating. (Low assertiveness and high cooperativeness). The accommodating style often
simply consists of giving in to another person’s wishes. Avoiding. (Low assertiveness and low cooperativeness). The avoiding style appears to indicate a
neutral position of participants which can often lead to ‘things working themselves out,’ but can
also result in an escalation of a situation by allowing it to go unresolved. Compromising. (Some assertiveness and some cooperativeness). The compromising style
requires a willingness of both parties to change, adjust, or give something up. Compromising
involves behavior that seeks to partially satisfy both parties’ desires and resolves the conflict. Note: All situations are unique, depending on the individuals involved, the criticality of the issues, and the urgency of the situations. When considering each of the conflict management styles, consider the who, the stakes, and the situation to determine the best approach to take to resolve
conflict. The USAF Negotiation Center (https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/AFNC/) has additional
resources on negotiation and conflict management. <!-- Page 264 -->

### Leadership Responsibility
Leadership is often indicated by a person’s title or position of authority. But leadership is an
ability we can all develop, cultivate, and expand upon. Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines the
word lead as, “to guide on a way especially by going in advance” or “to direct on a course or in a
direction.” A military leader is considered to be, “a person who directs a military force or unit”
or “one who has commanding authority or influence.” Leadership, as a moral quality put into
action through a command or leadership role, can serve to move mountains…or move people
over, around, or through mountains, whichever is required. Another way of looking at leading in the USAF can be recognized as the art and science of
accomplishing the USAF mission by motivating, influencing, and directing Airmen. This
highlights two central elements, the mission, objective, or task to be accomplished; and the
Airmen who will accomplish it. The science of leadership being observed and studied refers to
the methods and understanding of what leadership is. The art of leadership, being personal and
subjective, refers to the demonstration and application of leading. 14.7. Leadership and Management
While leadership and management are separate topics in many respects, they go hand in hand in
producing elements that promote mission success. Organizations need a strong balance of both. “Management is getting people to do what needs to be done. Leadership is getting
people to want to do what needs to be done.”
Warren G. Bennis, Ph.D. A leader is a person who leads or commands a group, organization, or country. Terms often
associated with leadership roles include flight leader, team leader, and squad leader. Warren G. Bennis, Founding Chair, The Leadership Institute, University of Southern California, labeled
three primary behavioral leader characteristics as the abilities to motivate, develop, and inspire. Under this model, leaders motivate and inspire people to interact and understand one another as
they move in the right direction by satisfying human needs for a sense of belonging
(belongingness and love), recognition (esteem), self-esteem (esteem), and control over their lives
(safety and security) which can lead to a sense of achievement (self-actualization). The model
developed by Warren Bennis echoes Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory (Figure
14.1.) for motivation which outlines the road to self-actualization. Abraham Maslow was a well-known psychologist who specialized in the theory of psychological
health. He is most famous for his theory on the Hierarchy of Needs which outlines basic
requirements that must be achieved before ultimately reaching self-actualization or fulfilling your
highest potential. Based on Maslow’s theory, in order to attempt success at one level, you must
be successful in the previous. For example, if you are hungry or thirsty (physiological needs), you
will not be able to focus on building relationships (belongingness) until you have food and water. This theory translates to the work environment as the individuals who are concerned about
keeping their job security will not be able to focus on striving for achievement, which will
<!-- Page 265 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
265
ultimately prevent them from reaching their full potential (self-actualization). Figure 14.1. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
A manager is a person responsible for controlling or administering all or part of a company or
organization. Terms often associated with managerial roles include career field managers, major
command functional managers, program managers, and project managers. Bennis labeled three
primary behavioral characteristics of managers as administrators, maintainers, and controllers. Under this model, managers focus on tasks a level of control to guide people in the right direction. Generally, managers ensure the resources needed are readily available and effectively used. Leaders launch and steer the organization toward the pursuit of goals and strategies. Managers are responsible for organizing projects, staffing positions with qualified individuals, communicating plans, delegating
to monitor
implementation. Leaders support these actions by aligning personnel needs, wants, emotions, and
aspirations with the task. responsibilities, and devising systems
Good management brings a degree of order and consistency to key issues like readiness, availability, and sustainment. Good leaders lead people to accomplish the mission. The best managers tend to become good leaders because they develop leadership abilities and
skills through practicing good management techniques. Similarly, an effective leader will often be
found to be a good manager. 14.8. Professional Associations
Private organizations develop professional skills and associations for individuals in many career
fields and technical specialties. Membership in such associations may provide additional
opportunities for leadership roles, public speaking, and mentoring, as well as broadening technical
expertise. Many units have unofficial organizations, such as the squadron booster club and event
planning committees. There are also organizations that tailor membership based on rank, such as
the Junior Enlisted Airmen Council, 5/6 Council, Top III, and the Chiefs’ Group. Taking an active
role in these organizations is highly encouraged for personal and professional development. <!-- Page 266 -->

### The Leader as a Mentor
Mentoring is a process of helping each individual reach his or her maximum potential. USAF
leaders have an inherent obligation and responsibility to mentor future leaders. Through
mentoring, senior leaders pass on their experience and wisdom to junior members as well as
philosophy, traditions, shared values, quality, and lessons learned. Commanders and supervisors must be positive role models and make themselves available to
Airmen who seek career guidance, counsel, and mentorship. They must take an active role in their
Airmen’s professional development by continually challenging them to grow, develop, and
improve. At a minimum, a supervisor’s mentoring consists of a discussion of performance, potential, and professional development plans during performance feedback sessions. Conversations should address promotions, professional military education, advanced degree
work, physical fitness, personal goals and expectations, professional qualities, future assignments, and long-range plans. “We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.”
Winston Churchill
Mentoring is an ongoing process and perhaps the most powerful method leadership can use to
shape the future. It helps prepare Airmen for the increased responsibilities they will assume as
they progress in their careers. At all stages of career development individuals would benefit from
the counsel of a mentor. Mentors are often appreciated more than they know. 14.10. The Air Force Mentoring Program
The Air Force mentoring program covers a wide range of areas, such as career guidance, professional development, leadership, USAF history and heritage, airpower doctrine, strategic
vision, and contributions to joint warfighting. But individuals must first focus on USAF
institutional needs. The USAF must develop people skilled in the employment and support of
airpower meeting national security needs. Mentors must distinguish between individual goals, career aspirations, and realistic expectations. Each individual defines a successful career, goal, or life accomplishment differently. There are
numerous paths to meet individual career and success goals. Although the immediate supervisor
or rater is the primary mentor, coach, counselor, guide, or role model, Airmen may seek additional
counseling and professional development advice from other sources or mentors as well. While
there are several approaches mentors can take in the form of coach, counselor, advisor, and
advocate, USAF mentoring is governed by DAFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program. 14.11. The Mentoring Process
The mentoring model, M – E – N – T – O – R – I – N – G, demonstrates the concepts of effective
mentoring. The elements of effective mentoring, described below, correspond to the letters in the
word itself. Model. An effective mentor, serving as a role model, understands that actions speak louder than
words. The protégé constantly observes and learns from the mentor. The opportunity to see how
the mentor deals with a variety of situations is an important part of the mentoring process. <!-- Page 267 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
267
Empathize. Mentoring requires the ability to empathize and show genuine compassion for
protégés. Mentors who remember what it was like when they were new and inexperienced may
be more effective in assisting others in their professional development. Empathy cultivates bonds
between mentors and protégés and fosters the mutual commitment that exemplifies mentoring. Nurture. Nurturing emphasizes a caring attitude. Like a farmer tends to the field, the mentor
nurtures the protégé, by investing time, patience, and effort. Mentors must make the time and
effort to effectively mentor their protégés and provide the appropriate amounts of attention, training, feedback, and time for them to apply, internalize, and value what they have learned. Teach. The skill of teaching may not come naturally to everyone, but knowledge and experience
are valuable as mentors. Consider these five simple steps when teaching and training protégés: (1) organize the material into logical, systematic units of manageable size; (2) correct errors
immediately; (3) frequently review previously covered material and relate the material to the
current lesson; (4) include practical exercises to help the protégé exercise the newfound
knowledge; and (5) evaluate protégé progress and provide detailed feedback. Organize. Mentors must themselves be organized before trying to help others become organized. An organized mentor knows from the very beginning what he or she wants to achieve, and focuses
on this goal. The time and effort spent organizing thoughts and materials into a logical, sequential
plan aimed at a precisely defined target pays big dividends in the form of improved learning and
developmental experiences for the protégé. Respond. Mentoring is a two-way communication process that requires mentors to actively listen
to the protégé questions and provide useful and timely responses. Effective mentors must remain
alert to recognize nonverbal behaviors and subtle communication cues that indicate the protégés’
interest in certain areas. Mentors should be proactive, anticipate the needs, problems, and
concerns of protégés, and address them immediately. Inspire. More than a good role model, teacher, or ally, an effective mentor is an inspirational
mentor. Inspirational mentors have a profound impact on protégés that encourages them to
transform into a more improved being. Inspiration is a characteristic that distinguishes leaders
from managers. Network. A good mentor introduces and connects a protégé with others who can provide
increased guidance, support, resources, and opportunities. Networking is a vital function that
helps protégés establish themselves in their professional community through a solid network of
friends, acquaintances, and associates. Goal-Set. Sometimes people lack the experience to understand the importance of setting goals or
the expertise to establish Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound goals. Mentors must help their protégés understand why goals are important; establish short- and longterm goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound; and be available
to assist them in achieving their goals. 14.12. The Leader as a Counselor
Being involved in an Airman’s development and growth is essential to a leader’s influence and
credibility. Leaders should seek to develop and improve counseling abilities to ensure effective
counseling is provided to Airmen. Counseling can be conducted for a number of reasons, ranging
from something as simple as discussing steps made toward achieving a goal, to something as
complex as addressing a significant life changing event. <!-- Page 268 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
268
### When to Counsel
The key to successful counseling is to conduct the counseling as close to the event as possible. Good leaders take advantage of naturally occurring events as opportunities for providing
feedback. Leaders must be genuinely interested in Airmen and understand how involvement can
help personally and professionally. Listening and providing assistance may greatly enhance an
Airman’s ability to deal with a situation. Professional growth counseling is often conducted while
reviewing an Airman’s duty performance during a certain period and setting standards for the
next period, typically, but not only during performance feedback assessments. Leaders may
conduct counseling for superior or substandard duty performance or behavior. Leaders may
conduct crisis counseling to help an Airman through the initial shock after receiving negative
news. Referral counseling may follow crisis counseling, which can help Airmen work through a
personal situation and may serve as preventive counseling before a situation becomes a problem. Referral counseling often involves agencies, such as legal services, religious affairs, or an alcohol
and drug counselor. 14.14. Approaches to Counseling
An effective leader approaches each Airman as an individual. Different people and different
situations require different counseling approaches. Three approaches to counseling include
nondirective, directive, and combined. The major difference between the approaches to
counseling is the degree to which the Airman participates and interacts during a counseling
session. Figure 14.2. summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Nondirective. The nondirective counseling approach is preferred for most counseling sessions. During the counseling session, the leader listens to the situation before helping the individual
make decisions or giving advice. The leader encourages the Airman to explore and clarify
important points to better understand the situation. During nondirective counseling, the leader
should refrain from providing solutions or rendering opinions, instead, maintain focus on
individual and organizational goals and objectives. Also, ensure the Airman’s plan of action aligns
with those goals and objectives. Directive. The directive counseling approach works best to correct simple problems, make onthe-spot corrections, and correct specific aspects of duty performance. The leader using the
directive style directs a course of action for the Airman. The directive approach is best when time
is short, when the solution is clear, or if an Airman has limited problem-solving skills and needs
guidance. Combined. The combined counseling approach is a blend of both the directive and nondirective
approaches, adjusting them to articulate what is best for the situation. With the combined
approach, the leader emphasizes the Airman’s planning and decision-making responsibilities by
listening, offering options, helping analyze possible solutions, encouraging the Airman to decide
which solution is best, and assisting with the development of a plan of action. <!-- Page 269 -->

May take too much time for some situations
One of the most important things a leader can do when conducting a counseling session, regardless
of purpose, is to ensure the intent is established and the environment is appropriate. Although the
length of time required will vary, when possible, conduct counseling during the duty day, aim for
the counseling session to last less than one hour, and be prepared to schedule a second session, if
necessary. Both the leader and the Airman should clearly understand why, where, and when the
counseling session will take place and be prepared to discuss main points, pertinent information, and plausible, obtainable goals. Finally, the environment should have minimal interruptions and
be free from distractions to show respect for the Airman and the conversation. Even when you have not prepared for formal counseling, you can follow the four basic
components of a counseling session: state the purpose, discuss the issues, develop a plan of action, and record the plan. These steps can be as simple or as elaborate as the situation requires. Also, schedule any future meetings, at least tentatively, before closing the session. Appropriate
measures to consider following the counseling may include a follow-up session, making referrals, informing the chain of command, and taking corrective measures. 14.16. The Leader as a Coach
Effective leaders often serve as coaches who must thoroughly understand the strengths, weaknesses, and professional goals of members of their teams. Leaders coach Airmen similar to
the way athletic coaches improve their teams: by setting goals, developing and implementing
plans of action, and providing oversight and motivation throughout the process. 14.17. Vision
USAF leaders must have a collective vision - a vision that empowers, inspires, challenges, and
motivates followers to the highest levels of commitment and a continuously improving
environment. Airmen are responsible for conducting and maintaining the asymmetric advantages
and capabilities the USAF delivers in air and cyberspace. We need to ensure we are also driving
efficiencies and improvements across the board. Therefore, we must use the right tools and
<!-- Page 270 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
270
techniques to address problems, leverage opportunities for improvement, and employ our greatest
resource - innovative, dedicated Airmen. Vision is helping people believe they can accomplish goals in the anticipation of a better future
as a result of their efforts. Inspiration is one way to convey vision. To better understand this
concept, consider President John F. Kennedy’s announcement in 1961 of the United States
intention to put a man on the moon within the decade. Perhaps an impossible task by most
standards, and yet it was achieved. The dramatic announcement and the infectious inspiration
helped achieve the goal. 14.18. Implementing the Vision
While senior leadership has the authority and responsibility to change the system as a whole, leaders at lower levels direct supervisors and subordinates to seek and perform tasks more
appropriate to the challenges of the new age. To do this, leaders must communicate the vision, bolster Airmen’s courage and understanding, and solicit ideas and suggestions. “A great leader’s courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion, not position.”
The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership
John C. Maxwell
Every leader needs to establish an enduring vision. As technology and our environment continue
to evolve, our vision and leadership style must keep pace. A vision that meets the organization’s
needs at the time of implementation, over time is likely to require re-vision, therefore the vision
forming process should be continual. On the other hand, the vision should not be arbitrarily
modified. If the vision works and is aligned with environmental and technological developments, the vision should be affirmed and supported. The ability to form mental images of a possible outcome and translate these images into a reality
through leadership and action is a unique feature of the human brain. A leader should constantly
anticipate the influences, trends, and demands that affect the vision over the next month, year, and even decade. To be of realistic value, the vision must be logical, deductive, and plausible. Vision must be specific enough to provide real guidance to people, but unbounded enough to
encourage initiative and demonstrate relevancy to a variety of conditions. Leaders with vision are
compelled to overcome complacency and refuse to accept the norm of doing things as they have
always been done. <!-- Page 271 -->

### Leadership Development
Leaders must effectively influence others, whether through expectation, delegation, or
empowerment. Qualities that facilitate followership and ensure credibility and mutual respect with
Airmen are also important. Three qualities that help leaders gain respect and credibility and have
a positive influence on others are self-awareness and empathy. Self-Awareness. Leaders must be fully aware of their own values and needs before counseling
Airmen. Self-aware leaders are more likely to act consistently with their own values and actions
and are less likely to project onto Airmen. Empathy. Showing empathy is being understanding of and sensitive to another person’s feelings, thoughts, and experiences to the point that you can almost feel or experience them yourself. Leaders with empathy put themselves in another’s shoes and see a situation from their perspective. Understanding another’s position can help the development of a plan of action—one that works. 14.20. Leadership Self-Evaluation
To successfully perform as a responsible leader, one must understand what is expected of them. The
following is a list of questions that offer a perspective for what is expected of aspiring leaders in
developing particular skills. Only the most honest responses will reveal one’s definitive strengths and
potential weaknesses. Pause and consider the importance of the following questions. Do I have the courage to make tough decisions and stand by them? Am I flexible when dealing with change? Can I remain enthusiastic and cheerful when I am confronted with seemingly impossible tasks? Am I willing to do my best with what seem to be inadequate means? Can I inspire people to achieve outstanding results? Am I willing to take reasonable risks to allow my Airmen to grow and become more productive? Am I willing to let my Airmen be creative? Does my manner invite communication? Do I really listen and withhold judgment until I have all the facts? Am I willing to accept my Airmen’s failures as my own and recognize their successes as theirs? Am I able to do many things at one time to manage a complex job? Can I carry out orders as well as give them? 14.21. Leadership Milestones
Life in the military incorporates a perpetual requirement for continued development. Effective
leaders must accept the responsibility of being both a master student and a master teacher by
embracing the role of both follower and leader. Setting high, attainable standards provides
opportunities for continual growth, as well as guidance and feedback. Giving Airmen a goal and
inspiration for developing and performing to their best ability is a leader’s direct line to

developing leaders of tomorrow. In business, successful corporations actively seek out people
with leadership potential and expose them to career experiences designed to develop their skills. They also value a combination of maturity, experience, and untapped potential as a valuable asset
to any organization. Valuing Experience. Leaders foster professional growth by insisting their Airmen focus attention
on the aspects of a situation, mission, or project they control, setting the stage for challenging, enlightening, and even adventurous experiences. As leaders progress and develop themselves, it
is just as important to allow Airmen to do the same while growing a sense of confidence in their
skills and abilities. Fostering Growth. The role of the leader in fostering growth is to identify knowledge and
improvement opportunities. This will ensure advancements are permanent and pervasive, not
temporary, or limited. Leaders encourage the learning process by formally and publicly
recognizing individual and unit successes, no matter how large or small. Facing Challenges. Developing Airmen for leadership positions requires consistent exposure to
challenges, with gradual increases in responsibility over time. Identifying people with leadership
potential early in their careers and then determining the appropriate developmental challenges for
them is the first step. Leaders must recognize the capabilities of each Airman in their unit or
organization. Those capabilities include any skills, talents, or experiences the Airman may have
that can contribute to current and future mission accomplishment. Professional Development. Leaders must also diagnose the developmental needs of Airmen, then
assist them with developmental needs that fulfill current or future jobs or roles and
responsibilities. Professional development needs may include off-duty education, professional
military education, specific skills
training, professional development seminars, and
communication skills development. Personal Development. Personal developmental needs may include relationships, interpersonal
skills, and off-duty education. Today’s effective leaders had opportunities early in their careers
that required them to lead, take risks, and learn from their successes and failures. Dealing with Setbacks. To learn and improve, people need to be encouraged to try new things. Airmen count on the experience and understanding of strong leaders in dealing with setbacks. An
Airman’s dedication to improving his or her abilities is a valuable asset to an organization. Followers must remain optimistic, even in times of adversity. Dealing with Change. Leaders must learn as much as possible about a change and its potential
direct and indirect effects before dealing with the change process. Furthermore, they must learn
how to deal with emotions often associated with change. The people supporting these processes
must be motivated to meet the challenge and support the change that is being implemented. To
achieve that, leaders must maintain a clear understanding of the present and a clear focus on the
future. 14.22. Leadership Styles
There are no secrets or magic formulas for successful leadership. Leadership is a responsibility
that requires an active role in engaging with individuals and teams to align their efforts with
personal as well as organizational success. Although the best advice is to just be yourself, ambitious and aspiring leaders can always benefit from the wise words of others. In 1976, Pacific
Air Forces Commander, General Louis L. Wilson, Jr., provided the timeless advice below. Be Tough. Set your standards high and insist that your people measure up. Have the courage to

correct those who fail to do so. In the long run, your people will be happier. Almost certainly
morale will be higher, your outfit better, and your people prouder. Get Out from Behind Your Desk. See for yourself what is going on in your work center. Your
people will see that you are interested in their problems, work conditions, and welfare. Many of
your people problems will go away if you practice this point. Search Out the Problems. If you think there are no problems in your organization, you may be
wrong. Your job is to find them. Foster an environment that encourages people to bring problems
to you that they are unable to solve for themselves. Find the Critical Path to Success. Get personally involved in issues on a priority basis. Let your
influence be felt on make-or-break issues in your organization. Avoid the activity trap—do not
spend your valuable time on inconsequential or trivial matters. Weigh in where it counts. Be Sensitive. Listen to your people. Communicate with them and be perceptive to their needs. Learn to recognize problems and seek out ideas. Be innovative. Recognize that effective
communication involves shared perceptions. Do not be afraid to empathize when necessary. Do Not Take Things for Granted. Do not assume things have been fixed—look for yourself. Furthermore, the probability is high that fixed problems will recur, so monitor your processes. Do Not Alibi. Remember, you and your people will never be perfect. People will make mistakes, so do not be defensive about things that are wrong. Nothing is more disgusting than the individual
who can do no wrong and has an alibi for anything and everything that goes awry. Do Not Procrastinate. Do not put off hard decisions, they will not be any easier tomorrow. This
does not mean you should make precipitous or unreasonable decisions just to be prompt; however, once you have arrived at a decision, get on with it. Do Not Tolerate Incompetence. Once people demonstrate laziness, disinterest, or an inability to
do the job, you must have the courage to terminate their assignments. You cannot afford to do
less. When your people do good work, recognize, and encourage them. They will likely do even
better. Be Honest. You must create an atmosphere of trust and confidence. When talking to your people, be candid and insist that they do likewise. They set their behavior patterns based upon your
example. Nothing is more disastrous than half-truths. Finally, be honest with yourself—do not
gimmick reports and figures to make things look good on paper. 14.23. The Power of Leadership
The concept of power in the workforce has many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to
harness different sources of individual power, particularly when in a leadership role. Taken from
Ken Blanchard’s Points of Power, Situational Self Leadership, developing one’s own sources of
power enables leaders to be less dependent on others, thus allowing them to take initiative and
make greater contributions in their jobs. Although the concept of power sometimes brings to mind
such associations as coercion, manipulation, and even corruption, this does not have to be the case
when the right people are put in the right leadership positions. It is helpful to develop an
understanding that “the sole advantage of power is the ability to do better.” Thus, if you want to
do more good for the people around you and for the organization, rather than rely on one aspect
of power where you are strongest, take advantage of opportunities to apply various aspects of
power in varying circumstances where most appropriate. Position power. Position power is inherent in the authority of the position you have. Your
position power may be indicated on your business card with a title printed on it that indicates you

have the power to manage people or command resources. Task power. Task power is power that stems from being good at a particular task and being able
to help others with a process or procedure they may be responsible for. Personal power. Personal power comes from your personal character attributes, such as strength
of character, passion, inspiration, or a personal vision of the future. Personal power is further
enhanced by the strength of your interpersonal skills, such as your ability to communicate with
and persuade others. Relationship power. Relationship power comes from association with others through friendship, familiarity with a colleague, cultivation of a relationship, preferential treatment, or reciprocity
(trading favors). However, perceived favoritism can have negative effects in the organization. Knowledge power. Knowledge power is about having expertise in an area, often through a
special skill or group of skills. It is often evidenced by having certain degrees or certifications
indicating special training. Knowledge power can generally be transferred within jobs or
organizations. 14.24. Full Range Leadership Development
A full range of leadership behaviors is essential in today’s complex world. Today’s USAF depends on
highly effective Airmen with the flexibility and capability to operate throughout a spectrum of leadership
styles. Full Range Leadership Development (FRLD) requires leadership to be viewed as a system made
up of three core elements: the leader, the follower, and the situation. Success of FRLD relies not only
on the leader’s actions, but also an accurate understanding of the follower and the situation and requires
today’s leaders to be willing to engage in several ways. Develop relationships with leadership, peers, and subordinates. Take advantage of opportunities as they become available. Efficiently use available resources. Properly evaluate situations and the performance of followers. Reward appropriately (and discipline accordingly). Identify improvement areas in oneself, followers, and the workplace. 14.25. Full Range Leadership Development Model
The FRLD model includes leadership behaviors ranging from the passive laissez- faire behavior, to active transformational leadership behavior. Developing leadership behaviors begins by
understanding each of them and knowing when or when not to apply them. In addition, possessing
the flexibility and capability to implement the appropriate leadership style successfully is critical
to leading others. Laissez-Faire. Laissez-faire leaders view the development and needs of their subordinates as
someone else’s concern. They tend to abandon their responsibilities and remain indifferent toward
important issues. They are hesitant to make decisions and may be absent from their place of work, which negatively affects relationships with peers and subordinates. Management by Exception-Passive. Management by exception-passive is an “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” leadership style. Here, leaders elect to sit back, observe, and wait for things to go
wrong before taking action. They intervene only when policies or rules are broken, or goals are
not met. Management by exception-passive is a little more effective than laissez-faire, but only
because subordinates know that leadership will hold them accountable if they fail to meet standards
<!-- Page 275 -->

275
of performance or comply with policies and procedures. Management by Exception-Active. Management by exception-active is a leadership style that
aims to keep personnel and processes in control by monitoring and governing subordinates through
forced compliance with rules, regulations, and expectations for meeting performance standards. Management by exception-active exists in a structured system with detailed instructions, careful
observation, and very active supervision. Furthermore, this leadership behavior reduces
organizational uncertainties, avoids unnecessary risks, and ensures important goals are being
achieved. This transactional leadership behavior reduces the temptation for employees to avoid
their duties or act unethically and aids members in meeting defined performance objectives. But
the leader has to be careful not to go too far and be perceived as a dictator. Contingent Rewards. Contingent rewards is a transactional leadership style that involves the
constructive transaction between leaders and followers. These transactions are contracts or
agreements where the leader sets goals, identifies ways for the subordinate to reach these goals, and supports the follower along the way. The follower is then required to perform their assigned
tasks to a specified performance level. When the follower achieves the leader’s expectations, the
leader reinforces the positive behavior by providing a reward. In other words, the reward is
contingent upon the follower performing assigned tasks to expectations. Transformational Leadership. Transformational leadership is a style of leadership that is defined
by the application of offering followers a vision and inspiring their mission. This type of leadership
inspires followers to exceed their goals and promotes positive, meaningful changes through
intrinsic motivation and encourages others to act because they want to. To motivate intrinsically, a transformational leader must consider ways to get others to embrace ideas, strategies, and
initiatives. There are four components of
individualized
consideration, intellectual stimulation, idealized influence, and inspirational motivation. transformational
leadership: Individualized Consideration (Nurturing). Individualized consideration is where leaders
treat their followers as individuals with different needs, abilities, and aspirations and not just as
a part of a group of subordinates. They empathize with and support each follower while
maintaining healthy communication. Using individualized consideration, leaders ‘nurture’
followers by acting as mentor or coach. Intellectual Stimulation (Thinking). Intellectual stimulation is the degree to which leaders
value their subordinates’ rationality and intellect by seeking different perspectives and
considering opposing points of view. Using intellectual stimulation, leaders stimulate and
encourage creativity in their followers, encourage followers to be independent thinkers, and are
not afraid to take risks and solicit ideas from their followers. Inspirational Motivation (Charming). Inspirational motivation is when leaders develop and
articulate visions that paint an optimistic and enthusiastic picture of the future that is appealing
and inspiring to followers. These visions elevate performance expectations and inspire
followers to put forth extra effort to achieve the leader’s vision. Idealized Influence (Influencing). Transformational leaders are charismatic and act as positive
role models who “walk the walk.” They exhibit high levels of moral behavior, virtues, and
character strengths, as well as a strong work ethic. They represent the organization’s values, beliefs, and purpose in both words and actions and, if necessary, set aside personal interests for
the sake of the group. 14.26. Leadership Attributes
Leading by Example. Leadership is modeling and setting the example for others - in word and

276
action. Effective leaders lead rather than drive people. They make fair and firm decisions that are
in the best interest of good order, discipline, and successful accomplishment of the mission. While
no one expects a leader to be perfect, a leader cannot demand the best from others if he or she
cannot demonstrate that they are willing and able to do the same. Through positive behavior, leaders live by their values and become good role models. They reinforce their credibility when
they do not dwell on the personal effort they have put forth. Involvement. A leader’s success is reflected in the efficiency, productivity, morale, and
enthusiasm demonstrated by the followers, and a leader’s involvement is essential to maximizing
worker performance and success of the mission. Leaders become a positive influence when they
are actively involved in their Airmen’s careers and lives. Learning from Failure. Leadership is about risks and rewards, and effective leaders realize that
failure is one of the greatest learning tools an organization has for achieving success. With every
risk there is the potential for failure; however, these are the moments which shed light on the faults
within an organization. Effective leaders realize that learning from failure empowers change and
inspires efforts to improve. Therefore, leaders never fear failure. Transparency. Direction, decisions, and actions are rarely challenged if the leader’s intentions
are transparent. Transparency is accomplished by integrating regular communication, shared
decision-making, mutual consensus, and healthy debate. Airmen should know the reason decisions
are made and how decisions will impact them and the organization. Flexibility. Leaders who are flexible listen to other points of view, bend when necessary, and are
not afraid to change course if things are not going well. Flexibility is an especially valued
leadership trait during times of change. Resilience. Leaders at every level within an organization constantly face challenges, changes, and
criticisms. Resilient leaders must possess a combination of compassion and grit to persevere during
times of uncertainty, deviation, turmoil, and conflict. Accountability. Promoting accountability in the workplace includes establishing clear roles and
responsibilities, cultivating a sense of pride and ownership among the members within the
organization, providing regular feedback to subordinates, leading with integrity, and setting a
positive example. Accountability does not focus on the discipline and punishment associated with
being unaccountable; but rather, concentrates on creating and sustaining a continuously learning
and always improving organization. Positive Attitude. Leaders must demonstrate the attitude they want emulated by their followers. Positive enthusiasm is contagious and can deliver energy to all aspects of organizational
operations. Encouraging Airmen, as well as oneself, is a powerful motivator. Effective leaders
constantly embrace positive goals and display a positive attitude. Values. The degree to which the values of trust, loyalty, and integrity are present in leaders of an
organization directly relates to the organization’s effectiveness. Leadership is the capacity to
generate and sustain organizational values, with consistency and reliability. Establishing values
must include a willingness to remove people who do not align themselves with organizational
values. Competence. Competence is developed with training, education, and experience. The skills and
abilities of a leader enable them to competently lead others to achieve the mission. Character. Character is who a leader is as a person with regard to personality. Character is
developed over time and through effort and ambition. For character to be effective, it must be
coupled with competence. While competence and character are individually considered valuable
<!-- Page 277 -->

277
leadership traits, a combination of both is needed for individuals to be great leaders. Charisma. Charisma is an energy that is emitted by leaders to inspire Airmen to perform a task
or objective when aspects of a mission are not intrinsically motivating or compelling. While
charisma can be effective at enhancing morale, its use should not be contrary to authority or
undermine commander intent. Compassion. Compassion is the sympathy and concern for the misfortunes of others. Compassion
promotes healthy, open, and honest communication, and provides the stimulus for Airmen to
discuss and deal with personal issues. Courage. Courageous leaders must demonstrate both moral and physical courage in combat and
in high-risk situations, as well as in day-to-day life. Leadership requires the courage to address
sub-standard performance or unacceptable behavior, welcome new ideas, do what is ethically
right when others prefer to do otherwise, and be honest. Acts of courage inspire others to maintain
composure in stressful situations, providing the stimulus and encouragement to endure hardships. Credibility. Credibility is the quality of being trusted and believed in. Credible leaders must
exercise and demonstrate humility, show commitment to the organization and mission, and
optimize operations by tapping into the unique strengths of each team member. Occasionally, leaders must be willing to work alongside their followers to get the job done. Credibility may take
years to earn through persistent, consistent, and patient leadership and can easily be lost with one
thoughtless action, decision, or behavior. Successful leaders earn credibility through leading by
example and taking responsibility. A crucial element of a leader’s credibility is taking
responsibility not only for his or her individual actions, but also for those of the Airmen. AFH 362647, Competency Modeling, includes attachments on developing self, developing others, developing ideas, and developing organizations. <!-- Page 278 -->
