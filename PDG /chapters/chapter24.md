Chapter 24—MILITARY CUSTOMS AND COURTESIES SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
### Honor and Tradition
Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions, deep-rooted in culture that reflect pride in
military service to our nation. Expectations for acts of respect and courtesy have evolved from the
need for order and discipline, to generating an environment of respect and sense of fraternity that
exists among military personnel. While not all-inclusive, this chapter highlights many of the
customs and courtesies that play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness. As stated in AFI 1-1, our customs and courtesies reflect the
unique nature of our profession and guide significant aspects of our behavior. Customs and
courtesies emphasize our strong bond with other military members as well as our mutual respect
for one another and our civilian leadership. 24.2. Protocol
Protocol is an internationally recognized system of courtesy and respect involving a set of rules
for behavior in official life and in ceremonies involving governments, nations, and their
representatives. Protocol for the military and government agencies is a code of traditional
precedence, courtesy, and etiquette in matters of military, diplomatic, official, and celebratory
ceremonies. In modern practice, military protocol encompasses the knowledge, accumulation, and
application of established service customs by combining the traditional codes of conduct with
contemporary etiquette and courtesy. Executive orders, presidential proclamations, USAF
instructions, and other service-associated sources provide specific guidance on protocol and
customs and courtesies. DAFI 90-1202 Protocol, is a very good source for detailed information
regarding a wide range of military customs and courtesies and decorum. 24.3. Base Honor Guard Program
Base Honor Guard is a mandatory USAF program, under the responsibility of installation
commanders, which emphasizes the importance of military customs and courtesies, dress and
appearance, and drill and ceremonies. The first base honor guard was activated within the 1100th
Air Police Squadron, Bolling Field, Washington D.C., and was responsible for maintaining a
USAF ceremonial capability in the National Capital Region. The primary mission of today’s base
honor guard program is to employ, equip, and train USAF members to provide professional
military funeral honors for active service members, retired members, and veterans of the U. S. Air
Force. Members are usually volunteers from the installation host and tenant units, with selections
generally coming from Airman Basic to Technical Sergeant. Note: In January of 2000, public law
was implemented, providing for all veterans to receive, at a minimum, a funeral ceremony that
includes the folding of a United States flag, presentation of the flag to the veteran’s family, and the
playing of Taps. 24.4. Symbolism and Representation
Military tradition and patriotism are steeped in symbolism, often honored in ceremonies, and
represented in many forms. Some of the ways the United States and the USAF are represented
include symbols, such as the United States flag and its colors, songs, official seals, and other
<!-- Page 544 -->

nationally recognized objects. 24.5. National Anthem
The United States national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner, is often played or sung at official
and unofficial ceremonies and events. It is important to understand the appropriate protocols and
procedures for showing proper respects for the national anthem. See Attachment 9, The StarSpangled Banner Lyrics, for all four verses of the national anthem. When the bugle call, To the
Colors, is played, the same respects are shown as rendered to the national anthem. National Anthem Outdoors. When outdoors, during the rendition of the national anthem, Airmen
in uniform should render the military salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position
until the last note of music has played. When outdoors during rendition of the national anthem, all
present in civilian attire should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Members not in uniform should remove their headgear with their right hand and hold it at the left
shoulder, the hand being over the heart. National Anthem in Vehicles. When on USAF installations, during the playing of The StarSpangled Banner or To the Colors, vehicles in motion will pull to the side of the road and stop (if
consistent with safety and mission requirements). Individuals in vehicles should sit quietly until the
last note of music has played. National Anthem Indoors. When indoors, in uniform, in formation, with appropriate headgear, military members should render the military salute during the national anthem. When indoors, in
uniform, without headgear, military members should stand and remain at the position of attention
without rendering the military salute. Civilians should remove any headgear and stand at attention
with their right hand over their heart. If the flag is not displayed, those present should face toward
the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. National Anthems of Friendly Foreign Nations. Anthems of friendly foreign nations may be
played to honor visitors of foreign nations as a show of respect. The same respect is shown to
foreign national anthems as is shown to The Star-Spangled Banner. Typically, foreign national
anthems are played before the national anthem of a host nation, but there is no regulation or law
mandating when or in what order national anthems are played when more than one is played. 24.6. The Pledge of Allegiance
The Pledge of Allegiance is not traditionally recited at military events. At outdoor events or social
functions where the pledge is rendered, military personnel in uniform will stand at attention, remain
silent, face the flag, and salute. When outdoors in civilian attire, remove any non-religious headgear
with right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the heart. At indoor events, military personnel in uniform will stand at attention, remain silent, face the flag, but will not salute; however, at indoor events where participants are primarily civilians or in civilian attire, reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance is optional for those in uniform. When indoors in civilian attire, stand at
attention, face the flag, place your right hand over your heart, and recite the pledge. 24.7. DAF Seal
As shown in Figure 24.1., the official Air Force colors of ultramarine blue and Air Force yellow
are reflected in the DAF Seal. The circular background is ultramarine blue, and the trim is Air Force
yellow. The 13 white stars represent the original 13 colonies. The Air Force yellow numerals under
the shield stand for 1947, the year the DAF was established. The band encircling the whole design
is white, edged in Air Force yellow, with black lettering reading “Department of the Air Force” on
the top and “United States of America” on the bottom. Centered on the circular background is the
<!-- Page 545 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
545
DAF Coat of Arms, consisting of the crest and shield. Coat of Arms – Crest. The crest portion of the Coat of Arms
consists of the eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American
bald eagle symbolizes the United States airpower and appears
in natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of six
alternate folds of metal in white (representing silver) and light
blue. This repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The
white clouds behind the eagle denote the start of a new sky. Coat of Arms – Shield. The shield portion of the Coat of Arms, directly below the eagle, wreath, and cloud, is divided
horizontally into two parts by a nebular line representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows striking
power through the use of aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist
with three natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning
bolts. The background at the top of the shield is light blue representing the sky. The background
at the lower part is white representing metal silver. Figure 24.1. DAF Seal
Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the DAF Seal and Coat of Arms. The DAF Seal is to be
protected from unauthorized use. Falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, altering, or
knowingly using or possessing the Seal with fraudulent intent, is punishable by law. AFMAN 33326, Preparing Official Communications, Attachment 2, outlines the authorized users and uses of
the DAF Seal and the Coat of Arms. 24.8. Official Air Force Symbol
The Air Force Symbol, as shown in Figure 24.2., was designated
the official symbol of the USAF on 5 May 2004. The upper half
includes the stylized wings, which represent the stripes of our
strength—our enlisted men and women. Below the stylized
wings, the lower half includes a sphere, a star, and three
diamonds. The Air Force Symbol honors the heritage of our past
and represents the promise of our future. Furthermore, it retains
the core elements of our Air Corps heritage with respect to the
bent up, rather than straight “Arnold” wings, and a star with the
circle. The current Symbol modernizes these core elements to
reflect our Air Force of today and tomorrow. All of the elements come together to form one symbol
that presents two powerful images—an eagle, the emblem of our nation, and a medal, representing
valor in service to our nation. Figure 24.2. Air Force Symbol
Stylized Wings. The wings are drawn with great angularity to emphasize our swiftness and power. The six sections of the wings represent our distinctive capabilities—air and space superiority, global attack, rapid global mobility, precision engagement, information superiority, and agile
combat support. Sphere. The sphere within the star represents the globe and symbolically reminds us of our
obligation to secure our nation’s freedom with global vigilance, reach, and power. The sphere also
reminds us of our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises and to provide
decisive air and space power worldwide. Star. The area surrounding the sphere takes the shape of a star. The star has many meanings. The
five points of the star represent the components of our one force and family—our RegAF, civilians, <!-- Page 546 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
546
Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star symbolizes space as the high ground of our nation’s Air
Force. The rallying symbol in all our wars, the star also represents our officer corps, central to our
combat leadership. Three Diamonds. The star is framed with three diamonds that represent our core values—Integrity
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the Air Force Symbol. The Air Force Symbol is a
registered trademark and must be protected against unauthorized use or alterations to approved
versions. Approved versions of the Symbol are available for download on the USAF Portal, under
the library and resources tab. Instructions for the proper use and display of the Symbol can be found
in DoDI5535.12_DAFI35-114, Air Force Branding and Trademark Licensing Program, 3 February
2021; in the DoD Guide, Important Information and Guidelines About the Use of Department of
Defense Seals, Logos, Insignia, and Service Medals; and at the Air Force and Space Force
Intellectual Property Management website (https://www.trademark.af.mil/). Refer to these
references for details regarding the use and display of the Air Force Symbol. 24.9. The Air Force Song
In the late 1930’s, the Air Corps sought an official song to reflect its unique identity. After
reviewing over 700 compositions, music instructor Robert Crawford’s song was a unanimous
winner. The U.S. Army band made the first recordings of the song in 1939, titled The U.S. Air
Force. According to DAFI 90-1202 when the Air Force song is played, Airmen will stand at
attention, but are allowed to sing the lyrics of the song. During official events, the official party
may move to depart after the playing of the first verse. See Attachment 8, The U.S. Air Force
lyrics, for all four verses of song. <!-- Page 547 -->

### Showing Respect for the Flag
The United States flag is one of the most enduring and sacred symbols of our country. It represents
the principles and ideals Airmen have pledged to defend, and for which many have made the
ultimate sacrifice. Airmen shall treat it with respect similar to that shown to the highest military
and public officials. Several laws, practices, and traditions are associated with the flag. The Title
## United States Code, Flag and Seal, Seat of Government, and the States; Title 10 United States
Code, Armed Forces; and Title 36 United States Code, Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations, pertain to proper display and respect for the flag. 24.11. History of United States Flag
There is no official meaning for the folds of the flag, and according to DAFI 90-1202 there is no
official flag folding script. Although various national interest groups hold flag folding ceremonies, they are not official. A narrative is provided in Figure 24.3. to highlight significant historical
information regarding the United States flag. It is not for official ceremonial use. For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our nation’s unity, as well as a source of pride
and inspiration for millions of citizens. Born on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress determined that
the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternating between seven red and six white; and that the union be 13
stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. Between 1777 and 1960, the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you today. The 13
horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors
of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and innocence; and blue
represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice. Traditionally, a symbol of liberty, the American flag has carried the
message of freedom, and inspired Americans, both at home and abroad. In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British shelling of
Baltimore’s Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star-Spangled Banner. In 1892 the flag inspired Francis
Bellamy to write the “Pledge of Allegiance,” our most famous flag salute and patriotic oath. In July 1969 the
American flag was flown in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the surface of the moon. Today, our flag flies on constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin flash of our aircraft
in harm’s way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the heart of every Airman who serves our great nation. The sun never sets on our USAF, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. Since 1776, no generation of Americans
has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom… Today’s Airmen remain committed to preserving the
freedom that others won for us for generations to come. By displaying the flag and giving it a distinctive fold, we show respect to the flag and express our gratitude to those
individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly flown the flag in every major conflict, on lands and skies around the world. It is their
responsibility…our responsibility…to continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and freedoms we, as
Americans, enjoy today. The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the pride and patriotism
we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy as a beacon of hope to one and all. Long may it wave. Figure 24.3. U.S. Flag
### Types of Flags
There are specific sizes, types, and occasions for proper display of the United States flag. Understanding the significance of each of these types of flags will ensure its proper display. <!-- Page 548 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
548
Installation Flag. The installation flag is lightweight nylon bunting material, 8 feet 11 3/8 inches
by 17 feet, and is only displayed in fair weather from an installation flagstaff. This is the typical
flag used at USAF installations. All-Purpose Flag. The all-purpose flag is made of rayon bunting material, 3 feet by 4 feet. This
size can be used for outdoor display with flags of friendly foreign nations, in arrival ceremonies
for international dignitaries, or to indicate joint occupancy of a building by two or more countries. All-Purpose (All-Weather) Storm Flag. The all-purpose, all-weather storm flag is a lightweight
nylon bunting material, 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches. Use this size as an alternate for the installation
flag in inclement weather. Ceremonial Flag. The ceremonial flag is rayon or synthetic substitute material, 4 feet 4 inches by
## feet 6 inches, trimmed on three edges with yellow rayon fringe 2 inches wide. Organizational Flag. The organizational flag is rayon or synthetic substitute material and is 3 feet
by 4 feet. This flag is trimmed on three edges with rayon fringe 2 inches wide. Retirement Flag. The retirement flag may be either 3 feet by 4 feet or 3 feet by 5 feet. Members
retiring from the USAF are entitled to presentation of a United States flag. For details, refer to
DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Technical Procedures, on using Organization
& Maintenance funds for this purchase. Garrison Flag. The garrison flag is 20 feet by 38 feet. This flag is flown on holidays and special
occasions and can be substituted with the installation flag. Interment Flag. The interment flag is 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches of cotton material. The interment
flag is authorized for deceased military personnel and for deceased veterans. This is the size flag
used to drape over a closed casket. Note: To receive an interment flag from the Department of
Veterans Affairs, fill out VA Form 27-2008, Application for U.S. Flag for Burial Purposes, available online at: https://www.cem.va.gov/burial_benefits/burial_flags.asp. 24.13. Display of the United States Flag
Sunrise to Sunset. The universal custom is to display the United States flag only from sunrise to
sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is
desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of
darkness. All other flags should also be illuminated when displayed with the United States flag. Locations. USAF installations are authorized to fly one installation flag from reveille to retreat, normally on a flagstaff placed in front of the installation headquarters, and additional flagstaffs
and flags are authorized adjacent to each dependent school on the installation. The flag should be
displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every public institution; it should
also be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse. Holidays. The United States flag should be displayed on all days as may be proclaimed by the
U.S. President, the birthdays of states (date of admission), and on state holidays. It should also be
displayed on the following national holidays. <!-- Page 549 -->

### Position and Manner of Display
The United States flag is always displayed on a stage or in a parade on its own right. In other
words, for an audience looking at a stage, the flag is on the audience’s left. When displaying the
flag, the union (the white stars on the blue field) is displayed at the uppermost, right side of the
flag itself. Figure 24.4. is provided as an example for proper display of the United States flag in
various situations and configurations. Carried in Procession with Another Flag. As a rule of thumb, when the United States flag is
displayed or carried in a procession with another flag or flags, it should be either on the right of all
others, or in front of and centered ahead of other flags, if there is a line of other flags in the same
procession. Displayed with Crossed Staffs. When the United States flag is displayed with another flag against
a wall from crossed staffs, it should be on the right, the flag’s own right (the observer’s left), and
the staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag. Radiating from a Central Point. When the United States flag is flown with a number of flags
displayed from staffs radiating from a central point, and no foreign flags are in the display, the
United States flag will be in the center and at the highest point of the group. Projecting from a Building. When the United States flag is displayed from a staff projecting
horizontally or at an angle from the windowsill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the
flag should be placed at the peak of the staff. In a Row or Line with Equal Height. When the United States flag is flown with a number of
flags displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be of the same height and same finial. The
United States flag will be on the right side of the group (the observer’s left). In a Row or Line with Elevated Height. When no foreign national flags are involved in the
display, the United States flag may be placed at the center of the line and displayed at a higher
level than the other flags in the display. Displayed with One or More Nations. When the United States flag is displayed with one or more
other nations, they are flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of equal
size. In most cases, member country flags are displayed in a line, alphabetically, with the United
<!-- Page 550 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
550
States flag at its own right (the observer’s left). Displayed on a Staff near a Speaker’s Platform. When displayed from a staff in a church or
public auditorium, the United States flag should hold the position of superior prominence and the
position of honor at the clergyman’s or speaker’s right as he or she faces the audience. Any other
flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker, or to the right of the
audience. Displayed Vertically. When displayed from a building, a window, or over the middle of a street, the United States flag should be suspended vertically with the union to the uppermost and the flag’s
own right, that is, to the observer’s left (north on an east and west street, or east on a north and
south street). This also applies when the flag is suspended from the main entrance of a building or
hangar. Displayed Horizontally. When displayed horizontally against a wall or when displayed behind a
speaker’s platform, the union of the United States flag should be uppermost and to the flag’s own
right (the observer’s left). When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same
way, with the union to the observer’s left. Displayed on a Closed Casket. On a closed casket, place the United States flag lengthwise with
the union at the head and over the left shoulder of the deceased. Do not lower the flag into the
grave, and do not allow the flag to touch the ground. The interment flag may be given to the next
of kin at the conclusion of the interment. Displayed at Half-Staff. The term “half-staff” means the position of the United States flag when
it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff. All flags displayed with the
United States flag are flown at half-staff when the United States flag is flown at half-staff, with the
exception of foreign national flags, unless the foreign country has granted permission for their flag
to also be at half-staff. Within the USAF, the installation commander may direct that the United
States flag be flown at half-staff on occasions when it is considered proper and appropriate. When
flown at half-staff, the flag shall be first hoisted to the peak for an instant, and then lowered to the
half-staff. The flag should be raised to the peak position before lowering at the end of the day. <!-- Page 551 -->

### Care and Respect for the United States Flag
Some acts for showing proper respect for the United States flag include: When in uniform, salute the United States flag six paces before it passes in a procession or parade
and hold the salute until it has passed six paces. Regimental colors, state flags, and organizational or institutional flags are always dipped as a
mark of respect to the United States flag. The USAF flag and organizational flags may be dipped
as appropriate. The United States flag will not be dipped to any person or thing, and at no time
will a foreign national flag be dipped. The United States flag should never be displayed with union down, except as a signal of dire
distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property. The United States flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, floor, water, or merchandise. The United States flag should never be used to cover for a statue or monument. The United States flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. The United States flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. The United
States flag should never be festooned, drawn back or up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall
freely. The United States flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as
to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged. The United States flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling. The United States flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it, any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature. The United States flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or
delivering anything. The United States flag should never be used for advertising purposes. Advertising signs should
not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the United States flag is flown. The United States flag should never be printed or embroidered on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, paper napkins, boxes, or anything that is designed for temporary use. The United States flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade, except from a staff. The United States flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle, railroad train, or boat. No part of the United States flag should be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a
United States flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. A United States flag lapel pin, being a replica of the flag, should be worn on the left lapel near
the heart. No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right (observer’s
left) of the United States flag, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at
sea when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the
personnel of the Navy. Exercise extreme care to ensure proper handling and cleaning of soiled flags. When the United
States flag is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, it should be
<!-- Page 553 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
553
destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning. There may be instances when a flag is
retired from service and preserved because of its historical significance. Disposition instructions
should be obtained from the proper authority, such as the installation honor guard or protocol
office. A folded flag is considered cased; therefore, a salute is not necessary. 24.16. Service Flags
In accordance with Title 10 United States Code, Armed Forces, service flags will be displayed by
order of service date, with the most senior service flags being given the position of honor on the
far right. Service flags will be displayed in the following order of precedence from their own right
or the observer’s left: National Guard (13 December 1635), U.S. Army (14 June 1775), U.S. Navy
(13 October 1775), U.S. Marine (10 November 1775), U.S. Coast Guard (4 August 1790), U.S. Air
Force (18 September 1947), and U.S. Space Force (20 December 2019). Following the service flags, the order of precedence of flags is as follows: North American
Aerospace Defense, U.S. Space Command, major commands (in alphabetical order), field
operating agencies, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, direct reporting units, Numbered Air
Forces, and wings (in descending order), and personal/position (using branch appropriate flags). <!-- Page 554 -->

### Showing Respect for Individuals
Respect, consideration, manners, common sense, and politeness are all ways of demonstrating
common acts of courtesy. Common acts of courtesy that contribute to a positive, professional
working environment include simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and respecting
other people’s time. When in the workplace, being helpful, taking and delivering messages, and
offering assistance, when possible, are demonstrations of consideration for others. All USAF
personnel should demonstrate common acts of courtesy while on- and off-duty. Distinguished Visitors. Certain individuals who are considered distinguished visitors (DV) are
often afforded particular courtesies as a matter of respect, as well as tradition. A DV may be defined
as any: (1) General or Flag Officer; (2) government official with rank equivalent to a Brigadier
General or higher; (3) foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary
of the Air Force for International Affairs; or (4) visitor or group designated by the commander. Persons in certain positions may be given DV status as designated by the commander. A DV visit is
an important event and should be given close attention to detail. Review DAFI 90-1202 and
AFPAM 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, and contact the installation protocol office for further
guidance on responsibilities and proper procedures for DVs. 24.18. Position of Honor
Junior personnel shall employ a courteous and respectful bearing toward senior personnel. Give
the senior person, enlisted, or commissioned, the position of honor on the right when walking, riding, or sitting. The junior person takes the position to the senior’s left. Entering or Exiting an Area. Unless told otherwise or impractical, rise and stand at attention
when a senior official enters or departs a room. If more than one person is present, the person who
first sees the officer calls the area to attention. An exception to this is when an officer is already in
the room who is equal to or has a higher rank than the officer entering the room. In that case, do
not call the room to attention. Entering or Exiting Vehicles. Military personnel enter automobiles and small boats in reverse
order of rank. Juniors will enter a vehicle first and take their appropriate seat on the senior’s left. The senior officer will be the last to enter the vehicle and the first to exit. 24.19. Ranks, Titles, and Terms of Address
Military personnel are addressed by the rank associated with their grade or title. While all USAF
personnel are Airmen, it is appropriate to address officers by their grade, such as Lieutenant
Colonel, and enlisted members by their grade, such as Master Sergeant. It is also acceptable to
address enlisted members relative to their tier, such as Airman, Sergeant, Senior, Chief, as
appropriate. USAF members may also be addressed as “Sir” or “Ma’am.” Chaplains may be
addressed as Chaplain or by their ecclesiastical title. Respect for Civilians. Civilians and civil service employees should be addressed appropriately as
“Mr.,” “Mrs.,” “Miss,” or “Ms.,” and their last name. Also, using “Sir” or “Ma’am” is appropriate. Respect for Retirees. Retirees are entitled to the same respect and courtesies as active military
members. They will be addressed by their retired grade on all official records and official

correspondence, except for correspondence and other matters relating to a retiree’s civilian
employment. Refer to AFI 36-3106, Retiree Activities Program, for additional details. Respect for Uniformed Forces and Other Services. Extend military courtesies to members of
other uniformed forces, other services, and friendly foreign nations. Pay the same respect to the
national anthems and flags of other nations as rendered the United States national anthem and flag. While not necessary to learn the identifying insignia of the military grades of all nations, you
should learn the ranks, grades, and insignia of the most frequently contacted nations, particularly
during an overseas assignment or deployment. 24.20. Rendering the Salute
Saluting is a courtesy exchanged between members of the U.S. Armed Forces as both a greeting
and a symbol of mutual respect. The salute is an expression of recognition for one another as
members of the profession of arms; representing a personal commitment of self-sacrifice to
preserve the American way of life. Salutes are appropriate to the U.S. President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Service Secretaries, all superior commissioned and warrant officers, all
Medal of Honor recipients, and superior officers of friendly foreign nations. A salute is also
rendered as a sign of respect to the United States flag and during official ceremonies, as covered
in this chapter. Saluting Uniformed Forces and Other Services. Salutes will be exchanged between officers
(commissioned and warrant), and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Armed Forces. Salutes will also
be exchanged between U.S. Armed Forces personnel and the Uniformed Services of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Public Health Service, as appropriate. Saluting Protocol. When a salute is exchanged among individuals, the junior member always
salutes the senior member first. The junior member should initiate the salute in time to allow the
senior officer to return it. To prescribe an exact distance for all circumstances is not practical; however, good judgment should dictate when salutes are exchanged. While any Airman (enlisted
or officer) recognizing a need to salute or a need to return a salute may do so anywhere at any time, there are circumstances when saluting may or may not be practical or warranted. Indoors. Salutes are not rendered indoors, except for formal reporting. When reporting to an
officer indoors, knock once, enter when told to do so, march to approximately two paces from the
officer or desk, halt, salute, and report, “Sir (Ma’am), (rank and last name) reports as ordered,” or
“Sir (Ma’am), (rank and last name) reports.” When the conversation is completed, execute a sharp
salute, hold the salute until the officer acknowledges the salute, perform the appropriate facing
movement, and depart. Outdoors. When outdoors (outside of a building, on a porch, a covered sidewalk, an entryway, a
reviewing stand, or at a bus stop) the salute will be exchanged. This applies both on and off military
installations. When Carrying Items. Individuals carrying articles in both hands (unable to be transferred to the
left hand) need not initiate or return the salute when impractical, but should nod or offer a verbal
greeting, acknowledging the appropriateness of a salute. In Formation. When in formation, members do not salute or return a salute unless given the
command to do so. The person in charge of the formation salutes and acknowledges salutes for
those in the formation. In a Work Detail. When in a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The person in charge
of the detail salutes for those in the detail. <!-- Page 556 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
556
In Groups. When in groups, when a senior officer approaches, the first individual noticing the
officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer and salute. If the officer addresses
an individual or the group, all remain at attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the
conversation, at which time they salute the officer. Public Gatherings. When attending public gatherings, such as sporting events, meetings, or when
a salute would be inappropriate or impractical, salutes between individuals are not required. In Vehicles. Exchange of salutes between members in moving military vehicles is not mandatory. For pedestrians, when officer passengers are readily identifiable (for example, officers in
appropriately marked staff vehicles), the salute must be rendered. This includes the U.S. President, the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Service Secretaries, and senior officers in vehicles when
distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags. In Civilian Attire. Persons in uniform may salute civilians or senior military members in civilian
clothes upon recognition. At “No Salute” Areas. Saluting is not required in areas designated as “no salute” areas. In Physical Training Gear. Saluting individuals due to rank recognition is not required when
wearing the physical training gear but may be expected during specified academic training
environments. When outdoors in physical training gear, Airmen are required to salute during
reveille and retreat. At Military Funerals / Memorials. When at a military funeral or memorial in uniform, salute the
caisson or hearse as it passes and the casket as it is carried past. Also, salute during the firing of
volleys and the playing of Taps. Note: Many installations across the USAF play Taps to signify
“lights out” at the end of the day. For these purposes, the salute is not required. <!-- Page 557 -->

### Military Ceremonies
The USAF has many different types of ceremonies that are unique customs of our military
profession, many of them held in honor of significant events throughout a member’s career. Official military ceremonies include promotions, changes and assumptions of command, activations and in-activations, re-designations, enlistments and reenlistments, awards, decorations, arrivals, departures, reveille, retreat, building dedications, ribbon cuttings, retirements, and
funerals. Some are very formal and elaborate, while others are quite simple and personal. 24.22. Event Planning and Preparation
All events begin with planning. Consideration should always be given to the nature and sequence
of the event, scheduling, guests, and budget. To give guests time to plan, aim at having details
planned out at least three weeks in advance, or more. In such cases, planning committees will need
to begin meeting and discussing details of the event far in advance of the invitations being sent
out. This could mean, depending on the size and scope of the event, planning as early as several
months to a year in advance. Because ceremonies are often steeped in tradition, there are almost
always resources available for helping planners get started. Rather than starting from scratch, reach
out to other organizations or review checklists from previous events to help get things started. 24.23. Parades and Honors Arrivals or Departures
Ceremonies, such as parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and other ceremonies that involve large
numbers of Airmen and resources, may be held when officials entitled to such honors visit military
installations. Full honors are reserved for statutory appointees and General or Flag Officers, foreign
dignitaries, and occasions when ceremonies promote international good will. The installation
commander determines which types of honors are rendered. Award Ceremony. An award ceremony affords an opportunity to recognize a member’s
accomplishments. The commander or other official determines whether to present an award at a
formal ceremony or to present it informally. Many units present awards during commander’s call. Because there are no specific guidelines for an award presentation, commanders and supervisors
must ensure the presentation method reflects the significance of the award. Decoration Ceremony. Decoration ceremonies formally recognize service members for
meritorious service, outstanding achievement, or heroism. Formal and dignified decoration
ceremonies preserve the integrity and value of decorations. When possible, commanders should
personally present decorations. Regardless of where the presentation is conducted, the ceremony
is conducted at the earliest possible date after approval of the decoration. All military participants
and attendees should wear the uniform specified by the host. Promotion Ceremony. Promotions are significant events in the lives of military people. Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring their personnel receive proper
recognition. Many of the guidelines for promotion ceremonies are the same as for decoration
ceremonies. Because most promotions are effective the first day of the month, the promotion
ceremony is customarily conducted on the last duty day before the promotion effective date. Some
bases hold a base-wide promotion for all promotees, while other bases prefer to recognize
promotees within their organizations. <!-- Page 558 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
558
Reenlistment Ceremony. Unit commanders will honor all reenlistees through a dignified
reenlistment ceremony. Airmen may request any commissioned officer to perform the ceremony
and may invite guests. The member’s immediate family should be invited to reinforce the
recognition that when a member makes a commitment to the USAF, the family is also making a
commitment. The ceremony may be conducted in any place that lends dignity to the event. The
United States flag has traditionally served, and should be used when available, as a backdrop for
reenlistment ceremonies. Reenlistees and officers administering the oath must wear an authorized
uniform for the ceremony, unless the officer performing the reenlistment is retired, then the
uniform requirement for the reenlisting officer is optional. DAF policy concerning reenlistments
is found in DAFI 36-2606, Reenlistment and Extension of Enlistment in the United States Air
Force. 24.24. Oaths
At the core of the ceremony is the oath. The oath is recited by the officer and repeated by the
reenlistee. The reenlistee and the officer administering the oath must be physically collocated
during the ceremony. The officer, enlisted, and civilian oaths are very similar, but vary to some
degree. If desired, the words “so help me God” may be omitted. Officer Oath
I (state your name), /// having been appointed a (rank), in the United States Air Force /// do
solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend /// the Constitution of the United States

559
the office upon which I am about to enter, /// so help me God. 24.25. Retirement Ceremony
Recognition upon retirement is a longstanding tradition of military service with a tangible
expression of appreciation for contributions to the USAF mission, and with the assurance of
continuation as a part of the USAF family in retirement. Commanders are responsible for ensuring
members have a retirement ceremony to recognize their contributions. They must offer the retiring
member the courtesy of a formal ceremony in keeping with the customs and traditions of the
service unless the member prefers otherwise. Family members and friends should be invited and
encouraged to attend the ceremony. During the retirement ceremony, the member receives a
certificate of retirement, a United States flag, the USAF retired lapel button, various certificates, and letters of appreciation, as well as appropriate awards, decorations, and honors. Spouses also
receive special recognition at a member’s retirement ceremony. Retirement ceremonies often
combine official, long standing USAF traditions with a member’s desire to personalize the
ceremony for family and invited guests. Anyone involved in planning a retirement should consult
DAFI 36-3203 for complete details. 24.26. Reveille Ceremony
The signal for the start of the official duty day is the playing of reveille. Because the time for the
start of the duty day varies among different locations, the commander designates the specified time
for reveille. If the commander desires, a reveille ceremony may accompany the raising of the flag. This ceremony takes place after sunrise near the base flagstaff. Shortly before the specified time, Airmen march to a pre-designated position near the base flagstaff, halt, face toward the flagstaff, and dress. The flag security detail arrives at the flagstaff at this time and remains at attention. A typical reveille ceremony will involve the following commands and procedures: The unit commander (or senior participant) commands “Parade, REST.”
At the specified time, the unit commander commands “SOUND REVEILLE.” The flag detail
assumes the position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and attaches the flag to the halyards. After reveille is played, the unit commander commands “Squadron, ATTENTION” and “Present, ARMS” and then faces the flagstaff and executes present arms. On this signal, the national
anthem or To the Colors is sounded. On the first note of the national anthem or To the Colors, the flag security detail begins to raise
the flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep it from touching the
ground. The unit commander holds the salute until the last note of the national anthem or To the Colors
is played, then executes order arms, faces about, and commands “Order, ARMS.”
The Airmen are then dismissed or marched to the dismissal area. Raising the Flag. When practical, a detail consisting of one senior member and two junior
members hoists the flag. The detail forms in line with the senior member carrying the flag in the
center. The detail then marches to the flagstaff, halts, and attaches the flag to the halyards. The two
junior members attend the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist the flag without
entangling the halyards. The flag is always raised and lowered from the leeward side of the
flagstaff. The senior member continues to hold the flag, taking particular care that no portion of
the flag touches the ground. When the flag is clear of the senior member’s grasp, the senior member
comes to attention and executes present arms. On the last note of the national anthem, To the
<!-- Page 560 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
560
Colors, or after the flag has been hoisted to the staff head, all members of the detail execute order
arms on command of the senior member. The halyards are then secured to the cleat of the staff or, if appropriate, the flag is lowered to half-staff before the halyards are secured. The detail is formed
again and then marches to the dismissal area. 24.27. Retreat Ceremony
The retreat ceremony serves a twofold purpose; it signals the end of the official duty day, and it
serves as a ceremony for paying respect to the United States flag. Because the time for the end of
the duty day varies among different locations, the commander designates the time for retreat
ceremonies. The retreat ceremony may take place at the squadron area, on the base parade ground, or near the base flagstaff. If conducted at the base parade ground, retreat may be part of the parade
ceremony. Shortly before the specified time for retreat, Airmen participating in the ceremony are
positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If a band is present, the band precedes the Airmen
participating in the ceremony. A typical reveille ceremony will involve the following commands
and procedures: If the band and Airmen march to the flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to the flagstaff
and halts, and the senior member gives the command “Parade, REST” to the security detail. As soon as the Airmen are dressed, the commander commands “Parade, REST.” The commander
then faces the flagstaff, assumes parade rest, and waits for the specified time for retreat. At the specified time, the commander orders the bandleader to sound retreat by commanding
“SOUND RETREAT.”
During the playing of retreat (either by a band or over a loudspeaker), junior members of the
flag security detail assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff to arrange the
halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are arranged, the junior members of
the flag security detail execute parade rest in unison. After retreat has played, the commander faces about and commands “Squadron (Group, etc.), ATTENTION.”
The commander then commands “Present, ARMS.” The members of the flag security detail and
members in formation execute present arms on command of the commander. The commander
faces to the front and also assumes present arms. The national anthem is played, or a bugler plays To the Colors. The junior members of the flag
security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity. The commander executes order arms when the last note of the national anthem or To the Colors
is played and the flag is securely grasped. The commander faces about, gives the Airmen in
formation the command of “Order, ARMS,” and then faces to the front. The flag security detail folds the flag. The senior member of the detail remains at attention while
the flag is folded unless needed to control the flag. When the flag is folded, the flag security detail, with the senior member on the right and the flag
bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the commander (or officer of the
day in an informal ceremony). The senior member salutes and reports “Sir (Ma’am), the flag is
secured.” The commander returns the salute, and the flag security detail marches away. The
Airmen in formation are then marched to their areas and dismissed. Note: Uniformed military
members not assigned to a formation face the flag (if visible), or the music, and assume the
position of parade rest on the first note of retreat. Upon completion of retreat, they should
assume the position of attention and salute on the first note of the national anthem or To the
<!-- Page 561 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
561
Colors. Lowering the Flag. When practical, the detail lowering the flag should be one senior member and
three junior members for the all-purpose flag, and one senior member and five junior members for
the installation flag. The detail is formed and marched to the flagstaff. The halyards are detached
and attended from the leeward side. On the first note of the national anthem or To the Colors, the
members of the detail not lowering the flag execute present arms. The lowering of the flag is
coordinated with the playing of the music so the two are completed at the same time. The senior
member commands the detail “Order, ARMS” when the flag is low enough to be received. If at
half-staff, briskly hoist the flag to the staff head while retreat is sounded and then lower on the first
note of the national anthem or To the Colors. The flag is detached from the halyards and folded. The halyards are secured to the staff. The correct method for folding the United States flag can be
found in DAFI 90-1202. 24.28. The Dining-In and Dining-Out
Dining-ins and dining-outs are both formal events. The one significant difference is that
nonmilitary spouses, friends, and civilians may attend a dining-out, but the dining-in is a formal
dinner for military members only. The present dining-in format had its beginnings in the Air Corps
when General Henry H. “Hap” Arnold held his famous wingdings. The association of Army Air
Corps personnel with the British and their dining-ins during World War II also encouraged their
popularity in the USAF. Members now recognize the event as an occasion where ceremony, tradition, and good fellowship serve an important purpose and are effective in building and
maintaining high morale and esprit de corps. Military members who attend these ceremonies must
wear the mess dress or the semiformal uniform. Civilians wear the dress specified in the invitations. Note: The combat dining-in is an event similar to the dining-in because it maintains the traditional
form; however, the difference is primarily in the dress and atmosphere. Combat dining-ins
typically celebrate the evening in some form of utility uniform in a much more relaxed environment
deliberately prepared to encourage camaraderie. 24.29. The Order of the Sword Induction Ceremony
Induction into the order of the sword is an honor reserved for individuals who have provided
outstanding leadership and support to enlisted members as a “Leader among Leaders and an
Airman among Airmen.” The order of the sword event is conducted with the dignity that reflects
its significance as the highest honor and tribute an enlisted member can bestow on anyone. Similar
to the dining-in, this evening affair usually consists of a social period, formal dinner, and induction
ceremony. The required dress is the mess dress, semiformal uniform, or equivalent. The only
approved levels for award of the sword are the USAF level and major command level. The Chief
Master Sergeant of the Air Force and MAJCOM command chiefs are known as the “keepers of the
sword,” and maintain the official lists of order of the sword recipients, respectively. History of the Order of the Sword. The first recorded order of the sword ceremony in the United
States was in the 1860s when a General officer was presented a sword by his command. The
ceremony was revised, updated, and adopted by the USAF in 1967 to recognize and honor military
senior officers, Colonel or above, and civilian equivalents, for conspicuous and significant
contributions to the welfare and prestige of the USAF enlisted force mission effectiveness as well
as the overall military establishment. <!-- Page 562 -->

### Military Formations
Ceremonies involving drill and formations honor distinguished persons, recognize special events, and demonstrate the proficiency and training state of Airmen. Whether giving or following
commands, good military bearing is essential to all involved in drill and formation. The precision
marching, promptness in responding to commands, and teamwork developed on the drill field are
key to the professional appearance and performance of the formation during ceremonies. The flight
formation is the most practical drill group and is composed of at least two, but no more than four, elements. For more information, see DAFPAM 34-1203, Drill and Ceremonies. 24.31. Drill Commands
Being in step with the formation, proper positioning, marching, and facing movements are all
necessary aspects of drill and ceremonies. Understanding proper procedures for drill are essential
for moving a formation in an orderly manner from one position to another. Standards, such as the
24-inch step, cadence of 100 to 120 steps per minute, distance, and interval, were established to
ensure movements are executed with order and precision. A drill command is an oral order that
usually has two parts: the preparatory command and the command of execution. The preparatory
command precedes the command of execution. It explains what the movement will be and what
elements or parts of the formation will be executing the movement. The command of execution
explains what movement will be carried out. For example, in the command “Flight, HALT,” the
word “Flight” is the preparatory command, and it designates the unit. The word “HALT” is the
command of execution and is the command to be performed by the flight. Supplementary Command. A supplementary command is given when one unit of the element
must execute a movement different from another unit or units, or the same movement at a different
time. Examples of supplementary commands are, “CONTINUE THE MARCH” and “STAND
FAST.”
Informational Command. An informational command has no preparatory command or command
of execution and is not supplementary. This command is used to direct others to give commands. Examples of informational commands are, “PREPARE FOR INSPECTION” and “DISMISS THE
SQUADRON.”
Mass Commands. Mass commands help develop confidence, self-reliance, assertiveness, and
enthusiasm by making the individual recall, give, and execute proper commands. Mass commands
are usually confined to simple movements with short preparatory commands and commands of
execution carried out simultaneously by all elements of a unit. Each person in the formation is
required to give commands in unison as if they were responsible for giving the commands to the
entire element. The volume of the combined voices encourages every person to perform the
movement with snap and precision. 24.32. Drill Positions
Fall In. The command for fall in is “FALL IN.” On the command “FALL IN,” individuals form a
flight in line formation. Line formation may best be described as falling into formation by forming
a ‘long’ line from shoulder to shoulder. Each Airman will fall in, automatically establishing their
dress, cover, interval, and distance, executing an automatic ready front, and remaining at the

position of attention. is “Flight, ATTENTION.” On
Attention. The command for attention
the command
“ATTENTION,” members of the formation come to attention by bringing the heels together
smartly and on line, as near each other as the conformation of the body permits. Feet are turned
out equally to form a 45-degree angle. Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the
knees. The body is erect with hips level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square and even. Arms hang straight down alongside the body without stiffness and the wrists are straight with the
forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first joint of the forefinger, along the seams
of the trousers or sides of the skirt. Hands are cupped (but not clenched as a fist) with palms facing
the leg. The head is held straight to the front, the chin is drawn slightly so the axis of the head and
neck is vertical, and the eyes are to the front with the line of sight parallel to the ground. The weight
of the body rests equally on the heels and balls of both feet. Silence and immobility are required. Open Ranks. The command for open ranks is “Open Ranks, MARCH.” The command “Open
Ranks, MARCH” is only given to a formation when in line at normal intervals. On the command
“MARCH,” the fourth rank stands fast and automatically executes dress right dress. The third rank
takes one pace, the second rank takes two, and the first rank takes three paces forward. The flight
commander aligns the flight, then commands “Ready, FRONT.”
Open ranks is a command given for inspecting the flight. After inspecting the entire flight, the
inspector marches off to the right flank (element leaders) of the flight. The flight commander calls
the flight to attention. The flight commander then commands “Close Ranks, MARCH.” On the
command “MARCH,” the first rank stands fast. The second rank takes one pace forward and halts
at the position of attention. The third and fourth ranks take two and three paces forward, respectively, and halt at attention. 24.33. Rest Positions
There are four positions of rest: parade rest, at ease, rest, and fall out. The commander and members
of the formation must be at the position of attention before going to any of the rest positions. To
resume the position of attention from any of the rests (except fall out, for which the commander
uses the command “FALL IN”), the command is “Flight, ATTENTION.”
Parade Rest. The command for parade rest is “Parade, REST.” On the command “REST,”
members of the formation raise the left foot from the hip just enough to clear the ground and move
smartly to the left so the heels are 12 inches apart, as measured from the inside of the heels. Keep
the legs straight but not stiff, and the heels on line. As the left foot moves, bring the arms fully
extended to the back of the body, uncupping the hands in the process and straightening the fingers
of each hand, pointing them toward the ground. Face the palms outward and place the right hand
in the palm of the left, right thumb over the left to form an “X.” Keep the head and eyes straight
ahead and remain silent and immobile. At Ease. The command for at ease is “AT EASE.” On the command “AT EASE,” members of the
formation may relax in a standing position but must keep the right foot in place. Their position in
the formation will not change. Silence is maintained. Rest. The command for rest is “REST.” On the command “REST,” the same requirements for at
ease apply, but moderate speech is permitted. Fall Out. The command for fall out is “FALL OUT.” On the command “FALL OUT,” individuals
may relax in a standing position or break ranks. They must remain in the immediate area. No
specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is permitted. <!-- Page 564 -->

### The Air Force Memorial
The Air Force Memorial, located in Arlington, VA, commemorates
“Airmen”–past, present, and future. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the
world witnessed the Air Force using advanced technology and delivering a
degree of air superiority undreamed of by the World War II Army Air Corps. Members from the Air Force Association and Air Force Sergeants
Association realized there was no national memorial to commemorate the
Air Force’s air dominance. On October 14, 2006, fifteen years after the 1991
Persian Gulf War, President George W. Bush dedicated the Air Force
Memorial to Airmen. Renowned architect James I. Freed designed the Air Force Memorial by first
borrowing the runway patterns from World War II airfields. He further
ensured the 5-pointed star remains prominent in the public eye as it is on Air Force aircraft, missiles, and on enlisted chevrons. The star is centered at the base of the three asymmetrical spires
reaching heights of 201, 231, and 270 feet. The spires, at the foot of a runway, are diametrically

opposed from World War II quotes by our founding fathers, Generals Billy Mitchel, Henry “Hap”
Arnold, and Carl Spaatz. On the northern and southern boundaries of the parade field stand 10foot high, 56-feet long granite walls. The theme of the northern wall is “Valor.”
All aerospace Medal of Honor recipients and their hometowns are listed beginning with World
War I U.S. Army Air Corps aviators, Lieutenants Bleckley, Goetler, Luke, and Rickenbacker to
contemplation wall engraved with the 4-ship missing man formation, paying tribute to fallen
Airmen. The southern wall inscription theme is Air Force Core “Values.”
The Air Force Memorial also lists two centuries of combat and contingency campaigns. Along the
walls of the campaigns are quotes defining their contributions to the nation. Central to the Air
Force Memorial is the 16-foot bronze Honor Guard Statue, created by renowned sculptor Zenos
Frudakis. The statue is a testimony to the Air Force’s military courtesies, dress and appearance, and drill and ceremonies. Most importantly, the Honor Guard statue represent what we value the
most–our people. “A Soldier can walk the battlefields where [they] once fought; a Marine can walk
the beaches [they] once stormed; but an airman can never visit the patch of sky [they] raced
across on a mission to defend freedom. And so it’s fitting that, from this day forward, the
men and women of the Air Force will have this memorial, a place here on the ground that
recognizes their achievements and sacrifices in the skies above.”
President George W. Bush

## Chief Master Sergeants Of The Air Force
Attachment 4
First Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Paul Wesley Airey
Paul Wesley Airey enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a radio
operator on 16 November 1942. By the height of World War II, he was serving as an aerial gunner aboard B-24 bombers. While
in Europe, Airey and his crew were shot down over Vienna, Austria, captured, and held prisoner by the Germans from July
## to May 1945. During the Korean conflict, he was awarded
the Legion of Merit for creating a means of constructing
equipment from salvaged parts, improving corrosion control of
sensitive radio and radar components. Following the war, Airey
took the job of first sergeant, a position he later said was one of
the most important in the Air Force. He subsequently served as
first sergeant for six squadrons at four bases over the next 12
years before being appointed to the highest NCO position. CMSAF Paul W. Airey
April 1967 – July 1969
Upon assuming his new responsibilities, CMSAF Airey began
tackling the problem of personnel retention, an issue he
identified as one of the greatest challenges he faced. The firstterm reenlistment rate was the lowest it had been in 12 years, but Airey did not attribute the great
decline to the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam. He felt it was the consequence of “poor pay, numerous remote assignments, good civilian employment opportunities, and an inequitable
promotion system.” He became an advisor to a committee to investigate and recommend a more
equitable system. His efforts helped produce the Weighted Airman Promotion System, which was
adopted in 1970, eliminating local enlisted promotion boards and equalizing promotion
opportunities across career fields. In retirement, Airey continued to be an enlisted advocate and
spoke to Airmen around the force. CMSAF Airey died in 2009. <!-- Page 598 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Second Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Donald L. Harlow
Born in Waterville, Maine, Donald L. Harlow was the youngest
of nine children. At age 22, after working a variety of jobs to
help support his mother and pay his tuition at a private
preparatory school, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps. Serving as an armament and gunnery instructor, he taught
cadets to fieldstrip and reassemble their weapons and to
synchronize firing guns through aircraft propellers. He
transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and advanced
to the grade of Staff Sergeant before his February 1946
discharge from RegAF. During the Korean War, Harlow was
recalled to RegAF, holding various positions in the personnel
career field. At 16 years of service, he was promoted to Chief
Master Sergeant and was the personnel Sergeant Major for
Headquarters United States European Command and the
Sergeant Major for the Executive Services Division, Office of
the Vice Chief of Staff. CMSAF Donald L. Harlow
August 1969 – September 1971
As the second to take the reins, CMSAF Harlow continued to cut a path through the
misunderstanding, confusion, and mistrust that surrounded the CMSAF. Ever vigilant, he
campaigned for and refined the newly established Weighted Airman Promotion System, garnered
continued flight pay for NCOs attending in-residence PME and worked toward equal per diem for
enlisted and officers. During Vietnam, he directed his attention to where he felt it was most needed: young Airmen and their issues, including racial tension, assignment concerns, and promotion
problems. Known for his no-nonsense approach and keen ability to listen, Harlow advised the
Chief of Staff of the Air Force on matters of true concern to the enlisted force. While many of his
recommendations did not result in policy changes during his tenure, he planted the seeds for future
change. After retiring, Chief Harlow was a strong lobbyist for enlisted equality. CMSAF Harlow
died in 1997. <!-- Page 599 -->

Third Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Richard D. Kisling
Richard D. Kisling and his 10 siblings were raised on a farm in
Iowa during the Great Depression and the dust bowl years. The
patriotism he developed during his childhood was called on
when he was drafted into the Army’s combat infantry in 1945
during the effort to reconstitute the number of soldiers driving
through France. After training and deployment times, Kisling
arrived in France a month before the war in Europe ended. His
unit assumed responsibility for negotiating the repatriation of
displaced Soviets. From there, Kisling separated from the
service for civilian life. After a few months spent missing the
camaraderie, he reenlisted for a brief stint in the Army. In 1947, he joined the Army Air Forces, serving first as a clerk and later
a personnel specialist. Upon his promotion to Senior Master
Sergeant in September 1958, he was among the first group of
Air Force enlisted members to wear the super grades of Senior
Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant. CMSAF Richard D. Kisling
October 1971 – September 1973
Once assigned to the Pentagon, CMSAF Kisling found the enlisted force struggling through the
development of a new Air Force. After talking with several base officials, it was determined that
the Air Force needed to develop their NCOs like they did their officers. So Kisling placed concerns
for NCO professional development in the forefront of discussion at the Pentagon. His persistence
paid off when the first senior NCO academy was approved by Congress in 1972. The Academy
officially opened its doors in January 1973; however, before the Academy opened its doors, the
original plan was to restrict its attendance to first sergeants. In the end, Kisling won the battle of
making professional development available to all senior NCOs. His concern for such enlisted
issues as housing, pay, promotions, education and training, and assignments earned him the respect
of his peers and the nickname, “the GI’s man in Washington.” CMSAF Kisling died in 1985. <!-- Page 600 -->

Fourth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes
Thomas N. Barnes grew up in the war-related industries town
of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined the newly created
United States Air Force as an aircraft maintainer specializing
in hydraulics. His first duty station found him at the leading
edge of United States Air Force integration efforts, as one of
the first African-Americans to join the unit. Barnes’ unit was
flying Korean War support missions. Unbeknownst to others
in his squadron, a crew pal taught him the art of flight
engineering and let him fly resupply and medical evacuation
missions. By his tour’s end, Barnes had gained flight engineer
certification, accumulated 750 flight hours over enemy
territory, and earned the Air Medal. He was the first CMSAF
with direct Vietnam experience and the first African-American
to serve in the highest enlisted post of a military service. The
Chief of Staff of the Air Force consecutively extended him in
## and in 1976. CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes
October 1973 – July 1977
CMSAF Barnes’ notable contribution came in the area that inspired his greatest passion and ranked
among his largest challenges: working to ensure equality among the ranks and races. He took great
pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He
labored to eliminate barriers for women and convince the Air Force to use them in nontraditional
roles. He understood the value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no one should
advance in rank without PME, working to establish the service’s firm commitment to enlisted
PME. Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate with anyone, Barnes made
listening to Airmen a priority. At the beginning of his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes
was, “What programs will you implement for the blacks?” “The answer was ‘None’,” Barnes
recalls. “I told them I work for all blue suiters.” After his retirement, Barnes remained actively
engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003. <!-- Page 601 -->

Fifth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Robert D. Gaylor
Growing up in Indiana, Robert D. Gaylor wanted to travel and
learn a skill. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1948, a transition
time for America and the military. As he arrived at basic training, President Truman issued Executive Order 9981, Desegregation of
the Armed Forces, 26 July 1948, establishing the President’s
Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the
Armed Services calling for equality of opportunity in the United
States military. Gaylor had had no experience with segregation
or integration, and he would witness the long journey to full
integration. His first duty was as a military policeman and he
excelled throughout his career, advancing to the rank of Master
Sergeant with only 7 years and 7 months of service. Serving as an
instructor at basic training and the NCO Academy convinced him
that special duties help prepare NCOs for greater leadership roles. In 1976, as a member of the Air Force Manpower and Personnel
Center, Gaylor traveled extensively, giving 275 leadership talks
CMSAF Robert D. Gaylor
August 1977 – July 1979
annually. CMSAF Gaylor’s goal as the senior enlisted man was to feel the pulse of the enlisted force and
serve as a conduit of information. He addressed low morale and the weak military public image
head on. He educated the force on the hazards of substance abuse and continued to raise confidence
and shift attitudes within the force. He is credited with securing a policy that allowed Senior
Airmen to transport their families at government expense during permanent change of station
moves, a solid step toward improving quality of life. He educated the force in order to eliminate
the stereotypes and prejudices working against equal opportunities for minorities and women. Finally, Gaylor promoted leadership. He traveled extensively, talking to Airmen about taking pride
in their military careers. He believes one of the most important roles a former CMSAF can play is
that of a link between the United States Air Force of the past and today’s service. Gaylor continues
to meet and serve Airmen, conducting more than 40 Air Force base visits each year. CMSAF
Gaylor died in 2024. <!-- Page 602 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
602
Sixth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF James M. McCoy
James M. McCoy was raised in the midwest, attending high
school in Atchison, Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College
in Atchison and St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa. He
seriously considered a vocation in the priesthood, but in 1951, during the height of the Korean War, he enlisted in the USAF as
a radar operator. When the war ended, the Air Force had too
many operators and needed military training instructors. McCoy
volunteered, and with only 6 years of RegAF experience, found
himself in charge of five groups of training instructors. He
continued working in PME, serving as NCO preparatory school
commandant and as an NCO academy instructor before
returning to the personnel training field in 1973. A year later he
was selected as one of the United States Air Force’s 12
Outstanding Airmen of the Year. He then became Strategic Air
Command’s first senior enlisted advisor. While there, McCoy
was a member of the Air Force Management Improvement
Group, chaired by CMSAF Barnes, which discussed management issues and proposed solutions. As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five phases. CMSAF James M. McCoy
August 1979 – July 1981
With the public still questioning military involvement in Vietnam, the Air Force was experiencing
the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF McCoy took
office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late 1979, along with former CMSAF
Kisling, he testified before Congress that people were not reenlisting in the Air Force because they
could not make ends meet on enlisted pay. McCoy worked with recruiters to get the right people
in the Air Force and sought to improve the PME system from basic training to the NCO and senior
NCO level. During his tour as CMSAF, the Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program was
instituted to provide incentive and an alternate promotion option for enlisted members. In addition
to visiting Airmen, he placed great value on being involved with the Pentagon staff. He expanded
the list of boards and conferences where he believed the CMSAF should have a role. In retirement, McCoy remains at the forefront of Air Force issues, having served in leadership positions with Air
Force professional organizations and speaking to Airmen throughout the force. <!-- Page 603 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Seventh Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Arthur L. Andrews
In January 1953, out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to
grow and develop, Arthur "Bud" L. Andrews enlisted in the Air
Force. During basic training, his training instructor asked for
volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant “air police,”
Andrews raised his hand. As it turned out, the training instructor
wanted area policemen. He spent the next 3 months picking up
cigarette butts outside the barracks. He eventually had an
opportunity to enter the military police force, where he served
most of the next 14 years. In 1959, while working as an
investigator, Andrews was credited with solving a murder
committed by an Airman Second Class. By 1970, Andrews had
served tours in Morocco, Thailand, and Vietnam; became a
first sergeant; and was promoted to the rank of Senior Master
Sergeant. During his career he spent a decade as a first
sergeant. CMSAF Arthur L. Andrews
August 1981 – July 1983
Upon assuming his new position, CMSAF Andrews’ top
priority could be described as getting back to basics. He believed the most vexing problems (such
as terms of pay, benefits, recruitment, and retention) had been addressed and were evolving to meet
Airmen’s needs. While he continued to advise the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on quality-of-life
improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He felt it was time for Airmen to “think we
instead of me, me, me.” He wanted people to focus on “how we’re supposed to dress, act, and react
toward subordinates and superiors, and how we’re supposed to do our jobs.” He challenged NCOs
to “take care of their people and to accomplish the mission.” He further suggested that NCOs look
at themselves if they were dissatisfied with their jobs. He dispelled the days of “leadership by stress”
and applauded PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews believed the CMSAF needed to know the
issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively around the Air Force. CMSAF Andrews died
in 1996. <!-- Page 604 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Eighth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Sam E. Parish
Sam E. Parish was raised and educated in north Florida. In 1955, at age 17, he joined the Air Force as a ground weather
equipment operator. His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air
Base, Germany, brought him into an experimental program to
cross train as a weather observer. That experiment led to a
career. In 1960, he became the youngest 7-skill level in his
career field and continued to excel. While the chief observer for
the 7th Weather Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was
quickly promoted to Senior Master Sergeant, and at age 31, Parish made Chief Master Sergeant. He was a member of the
first senior NCO academy class and was selected as the Air
Weather Service Senior Enlisted Advisor in 1973. He returned
to Germany in 1976 as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office
Personnel Sergeant Major, and in 1977 became the senior
enlisted advisor for the United States Air Forces in Europe, where he established the United States Air Forces in Europe First Sergeant of the Year program. Parish later served as the 40th Air Division and Strategic Air Command senior enlisted advisor. CMSAF Sam E. Parish
August 1983 – June 1986
CMSAF Parish tackled a range of enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was
the fixed-phase point for promotion to Senior Airman, which would promote qualified Airmen to
Senior Airman at a set point in their initial enlistment, allowing them a chance to be selected for
Staff Sergeant during their first enlistment. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force
approval to allow flight line personnel to wear a functional badge on their uniform, which led to
USAF members in all specialties being able to wear functional badges identifying their career
fields. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force approval to establish the Levitow Award
for each level of PME and to implement the First Sergeant of the Year Program Air Force-wide. He was known as a straight shooter who did not waste time trying to figure out what people wanted
to hear. Instead, he told them what they needed to hear. To Parish, the CMSAF is the most
important job in the Air Force from an enlisted program perspective. In retirement, he continues
to support Airmen by attending service functions and visiting bases throughout the Air Force. <!-- Page 605 -->

Ninth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF James C. Binnicker
James C. Binnicker, raised in Aiken, South Carolina, joined the
Civil Air Patrol in high school with aspirations of becoming a
pilot. Cadet of the Year honors earned him a scholarship to
attend flight school and the right to represent his state as a
foreign exchange cadet in Great Britain. In 1957, when doctors
detected a high frequency hearing loss, he was disqualified from
the program. To stay close to his passion, he joined the Air
Force in the personal equipment, life support career field. By
1964, Binnicker cross-trained into air operations, planning
flights for missions to Vietnam. While serving in Vietnam from
## to 1969, he served as NCOIC of operations for the 22d
Tactical Air Support Squadron, and later as a Vietnamesespeaking linguist at the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces
Language School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he set his sights
on becoming the CMSAF, advocating for enlisted Airmen, and
served as a first sergeant and base sergeant major at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina. In
1977, upon recommendation of CMSAF Thomas Barnes, he became the sole enlisted member of
the newly established President’s Commission on Military Compensation. He also spent over 7
years as the senior enlisted advisor for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th Air Force, Pacific Air
Forces, and Tactical Air Command. CMSAF James C. Binnicker
July 1986 – July 1990
CMSAF Binnicker’s first order of business was tackling the Airman performance report, a system
of ratings from 1 to 9. To more accurately differentiate between Airmen, the enlisted performance
report was created, along with a system to provide and document performance feedback. Next, Binnicker set his sights on admitting master sergeants to the SNCO academy. He believed giving
Airmen all the responsibility they could handle would result in attracting and retaining higher
quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give minorities and women more responsibilities
throughout the Air Force. The Air Force Chief of Staff recognized Binnicker as a staunch advocate
and spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment to Airmen did not change following his
retirement in 1994. He stayed abreast of issues affecting the enlisted force and visited PME classes
to talk with students worldwide. In addition, he served as president and chief executive officer for
the Air Force Enlisted Village until his death in March 2015. <!-- Page 606 -->

Tenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Gary R. Pfingston
Gary R. Pfingston played minor league baseball before enlisting
in the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his first
assignment as a B-52 crew chief at Castle AFB, California, he
went to work one day with a pack of cigarettes and $2 and did
not return home for 30 days because the Cuban Missile Crisis
sent the base into lockdown. Ten years later, Pfingston worked
aircraft maintenance in Thailand, reconfiguring B-52s to carry
conventional bombs in what became known as “iron belly”
modifications. In 1973, he returned to the U.S. and spent the
next 8 1/2 years as a military training instructor, and later, chief
of the military training division. During an assignment to
Andersen AFB, Guam, Pfingston broke his back, was
hospitalized for 147 days, and returned to duty as the first
sergeant. Future assignments had Pfingston taking part in the first
ability to survive and operate exercise
in a chemical
environment and serving as a senior enlisted advisor. CMSAF Gary R. Pfingston
August 1990 – October 1994
CMSAF Pfingston’s focus during his tenure was the Air Force drawdown and budget. Holding the
highest enlisted position during Desert Storm, he worked to restore basic allowance for subsistence
to the troops living in field conditions and increasing the Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance, but the toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force downsizing. To avoid involuntary
separations, Pfingston worked to implement the Voluntary Separation Incentive and Special
Separation Bonus Programs. His idea to provide career paths and milestones in line with the officer
career model, led to the career field education and training plan, three-level, and seven-level
technical schools for all career fields, and mandatory in-residence PME schools. He also found
himself involved with issues such as homosexuals serving in the military, Air Force specialty codes
opening up to women, assignment policies including the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing
(EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the introduction of the new senior NCO stripes. Pfingston
remained active in what he called the “communication chain” of former CMSAFs advocating for
the enlisted force after his retirement. CMSAF Pfingston died in 2007. <!-- Page 607 -->

Eleventh Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF David J. Campanale
Worcester, Massachusetts, native David J. Campanale said he
had the world by the throat after high school. A promising
athlete, when a baseball career fell through, his mother
encouraged him to join the Air Force in 1970. Campanale
completed aircraft maintenance technical school despite poor
study habits and breaking his collarbone playing football. He
credits his supervisors at his first base with turning his attitude
around. Campanale sought challenges, volunteering for several
tours to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc
Light missions in Southeast Asia. He later volunteered to transfer
to aerial repair. As he rose through the ranks, Campanale earned
the distinguished graduate award at both the NCO academy and
senior NCO academy and was stripes for exceptional performerpromoted to Master Sergeant. He later served as a senior enlisted
advisor; a role called “richly rewarding.”
CMSAF David J. Campanale
October 1994 – November 1996
The year CMSAF Campanale began his tour, the military
launched the new TRICARE health program. The change introduced many questions and a great
deal of anxiety. He led the charge to alleviate those feelings through education. Also, when
Congress threatened to change the retirement system to “High One” effectively reducing
retirement pay, Campanale quickly responded. With senior leader support, Campanale stood
before Congress in the successful fight against the proposed change. Another important recruitment
and retention milestone was adoption of the one-plus-one dormitory standard, which gave each
Airman his or her own room. Not a proponent of long speeches, while visiting bases he encouraged
questions rather than delivering a speech, which created meaningful dialogue. He believes anyone
can become CMSAF and offers those who want to follow in his footsteps this piece of advice: Be
honest and keep your promise. Campanale continues to actively mentor Airmen serving today. <!-- Page 608 -->

Twelfth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Eric W. Benken
Raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, after graduating high school Eric W. Benken moved to Houston, Texas, to join his parents. Struggling
to find a good paying job out of the area, he joined the Air Force
as an administrative specialist. Although first assigned to
Ellington AFB, Texas, he would get his chance to travel 9
months later, on orders to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan. During his tour, he deployed to South Vietnam, where he spent
his 20th birthday. As the U.S. Air Forces Europe senior enlisted
advisor, he facilitated the highly successful beddown of forces
during the Bosnia Operation Joint Endeavor. He led numerous
quality-of-life initiatives, including eliminating/ remodeling a
third of the U.S. Air Forces Europe zero-privacy dormitories, making way for the newly developed one-plus-one dormitories. Benken also crafted the NCO Professional Development
Seminar, an effort to fill a career education void between Airman
CMSAF Eric W. Benken
November 1996 – August 1999
Leadership School and the NCO academy. During his tenure, CMSAF Benken focused heavily on fundamentals, getting back to basics, and
changing the culture of the Air Force to meet new expeditionary requirements. He championed
Warrior Week at basic training and ensured funding for a simulated deployed location at Lackland
AFB, Texas. He instituted First Sergeant Academy curriculum changes, focusing on deployment
responsibilities. He believed changing the title “senior enlisted advisor” to “Command Chief
Master Sergeant” and adding the star to the chevron were critical to the success of these positions, in garrison and on the battlefield. CMSAF Benken engaged Congress and special interest groups
on numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts to alter basic military training and reversing the
diminished retirement system of 1986. Other significant challenges included ensuring TRICARE
met health care needs and modernizing the force with a limited budget. He believed Air Force
leaders should focus on the future and prepare the force for the next century. Benken served as the
first co-chair of the Air Force Retiree Council, serves on the board of directors for the Airmen
Memorial Foundation and the Mission Readiness Organization Executive Advisory Council, and
continues to speak at a variety of Air Force functions. <!-- Page 609 -->

Thirteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Jim Finch
Jim Finch entered the Air Force from East Hampton, New York, expecting to do only a 4-year hitch. He planned to learn a trade
and see what the world had to offer and move on. Finch spent
the early part of his career in the “bomb dumps” as a missile
maintenance crew chief before becoming a PME instructor. After 4 years of teaching, Finch moved to the Leadership and
Management Development Center at Maxwell Air Force Base
Alabama. While there, he helped develop a correspondence
version of the NCO preparatory course and taught new PME
instructors. He was subsequently selected as the Air Force NCO
PME functional manager at the Air Force Military Personnel
Center. While there, he was involved in restructuring the PME
program from four to three levels and implementing procedures
to create Airman Leadership School and allow Master Sergeants
to attend the senior NCO academy. Finch later served as an NCO Academy commandant, the 11th
Air Force senior enlisted advisor, and Air Combat Command, Command Chief Master Sergeant. CMSAF Frederick J. Finch
August 1999 – June 2002
When CMSAF Finch took the reins, the Air Force was moving from a cold war to an expeditionary
mindset. He implemented CMSAF Benken’s basic training Warrior Week vision to help new
recruits understand that the expeditionary Air Force was not a temporary concept. He credits the
program’s success to the men and women at Lackland. Known as a man of vision, he spent 3 years
focusing on enlisted members’ concerns, and implementing programs to improve future
preparedness. Finch recognized that the armed forces had to change to meet changing threats to
national security. He believed future-focused leaders were paramount to success and made
significant contributions to ensure the force developed that kind of leader. Finch maintains his
vision for Airmen by serving on boards of Air Force-associated organizations, visiting Air Force
members worldwide, and supporting current CMSAF agendas. <!-- Page 610 -->

Fourteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Gerald R. Murray
Gerald R. Murray, a native of Boiling Springs, North Carolina, grew up on his grandfather’s farm. Graduating high school in
1974, he briefly attended college, married, and worked in textile
mills and construction before entering the Air Force as an F-4
aircraft crew chief in 1977. Murray’s performance and
capabilities were quickly recognized by his promotion to Senior
Airman below the zone, and selection as an F-16 aircraft
maintenance instructor. He continued to excel as the senior F-16
crew chief on "Victor Alert" at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and later
as an A-10 squadron production superintendent. Deployed in
support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he played
a key role as the combat turn director at the most forward
operation location in theater, garnering the Bronze Star, and later
the Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy. After standing up a
new A-10 squadron at Moody AFB, Georgia, Murray’s
performance, and leadership were recognized again when he was pulled from the flight line to
serve as the 347th Wing Senior Enlisted Advisor and Command Chief Master Sergeant. He later
served as the Command Chief Master Sergeant at 5th Air Force, U.S. Forces Japan, and Pacific
Air Forces Command. CMSAF Gerald R. Murray
July 2002 – June 2006
An evolving Air Force and a changed world after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks were
catalysts for change during Murray’s tenure. Murray refocused basic military training and PME
toward expeditionary combat principles and took a leading role in developing a new physical
fitness program to improve Air Force-wide readiness. Additionally, Murray led efforts to balance
the enlisted force structure by increasing high-year tenure for four enlisted grades, bringing back
the career job reservation and NCO retraining programs, and redistributing SNCO promotions in
critical and unbalanced Air Force specialty codes. Understanding the need to maintain strong
leadership, he initiated a deliberate approach to NCO professional development; led changes to the
management of Chief Master Sergeants, including alignment under the Air Force Senior Leaders
Management Office, and added a Chief Master Sergeant leadership course to the enlisted PME
continuum. In retirement, Murray remains active in shaping Airmen development, serving with
Air Force professional organizations and continuing to speak throughout the force. <!-- Page 611 -->

Fifteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF Rodney J. McKinley
Rodney J. McKinley grew up in Mt. Orab, Ohio, and originally
entered the Air Force in 1974 as a medical technician. He
separated from the Air Force in 1977 to pursue an education. He
returned to RegAF in 1982 as an aircraft maintenance specialist
and served in various aircraft maintenance positions at Myrtle
Beach AFB, South Carolina, and Clark Air Base, Philippines. In
1991, he became a first sergeant, a position he held for the next
## years, with assignments at Myrtle Beach AFB, South
Carolina; Ghedi Air Base, Italy; Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. McKinley then served as a
command Chief Master Sergeant at Ramstein Air Base, Germany; Langley AFB, Virginia; and 11th Air Force at
Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. In 2003, during the early days of
Operation Iraqi Freedom, he deployed as Command Chief
Master Sergeant to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia. Before being selected as the 15th CMSAF, he was the Pacific Air Forces
Command Chief Master Sergeant at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. CMSAF Rodney J. McKinley
June 2006 – June 2009
During his tenure, CMSAF McKinley was an advocate for winning the Global War on Terrorism, developing, and taking care of Airmen, and modernizing aging air, space, and cyberspace assets. McKinley focused on properly organizing, training, and equipping Airmen during a time when
many were being tasked outside their core competencies. His efforts to improve the enlisted
evaluation system resulted in the first major changes to feedback and performance report forms
since 1990. CMSAF McKinley also advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly
encouraged Airmen to pursue a Community College of the Air Force degree earlier in their careers. A strong advocate for the “American Airman” spirit, he opened the door for creation of the
Airman’s Creed, which codified core Air Force beliefs and articulated the warrior ethos. His vision
led to the creation of the Enlisted Heroes Walk on the parade field at Lackland AFB, Texas, and
the return of the enlisted collar brass and Good Conduct Medal. CMSAF McKinley also pursued
improvements in Airman health and fitness, wounded warrior care, childcare, spousal employment
opportunities, and accompanied and unaccompanied housing. <!-- Page 612 -->

Sixteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF James A. Roy

Force Base, Florida; Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea; Kunsan
Air Base, Korea; Andersen Air Force Base, Guam; and Keesler
Air Force Base, Mississippi. He returned to the site of his
original technical training—Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri—as
an instructor and instructor supervisor. As a Senior Master
Sergeant, he transferred into personnel as the military personnel
flight superintendent, Keesler Air Force Base, in 1999. From
there, Chief Roy served as a Command Chief Master Sergeant
at wing, numbered Air Force, and unified combatant command
levels. These assignments included Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Charleston Air Force Base South Carolina; Langley
Air Force Base, Virginia; and 5th Air Force and United States
Forces Japan, at Yokota Air Base, Japan. In October 2004, he deployed as the 386th Air
Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia Command Chief Master Sergeant. He then served as the
United States Pacific Command senior enlisted leader at Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii. CMSAF James A. Roy
June 2009 – January 2013
Chief Roy’s key focus areas included ensuring Airmen were ready for joint and coalition
operations; deliberately developing Airmen through education, training, and experience; and
building a culture of resiliency within Airmen and their families. He worked to expand and solidify
training and engagement in joint and coalition environments, which helped enhance the
employability of Airmen in the increasingly joint and coalition warfighting environment. He also
stressed the importance of updating and expanding distance-learning opportunities, and developed
and promoted the Enlisted PME-Next construct, designed to close the gap in PME following
Airman Leadership School. <!-- Page 613 -->

Seventeenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
CMSAF James A. Cody
James A. Cody grew up in Lakeville, Massachusetts, and entered
the Air Force in 1984 as an air traffic controller. He served in
various air traffic control positions at Ramstein Air Base, Germany; Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire; Vandenberg
Air Force Base, California; Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea; Incirlik Air Base, Turkey; Langley Air Force Base, Virginia; and
MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. In April 2002, he deployed as
the superintendent of the Joint Task Force– Southwest Asia

assignments to Travis Air Force Base, California; MacDill Air
Force Base, Florida; 18th Air Force at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, and Air Education and Training Command at Joint Base
San Antonio-Randolph, Texas. CMSAF James A. Cody
January 2013 – February 2017
Immediately upon assuming the position, Chief Cody committed to the continued evolution of the
enlisted force. He identified various policies and processes, and with the support of the Air Force
Chief of Staff and Enlisted Board of Directors moved each of them forward to ensure the enlisted
force was prepared for future challenges. He focused on the deliberate development of Airmen, evolving enlisted PME to a blended learning model, and establishing Developmental Special
Duties, which ensured top Airmen were in leadership positions that best leveraged their proven
performance across the force. He heightened the conversation surrounding work/life balance and
the importance of finding a reasonable and sustainable demand signal for Airmen, and
strengthened care and support programs for Wounded Warriors, including Airmen with invisible
wounds such as traumatic brain injury and/or PTSD. Additionally, Chief Cody moved the Enlisted
Evaluation System and Weighted Airman Promotion System forward to ensure they served today's
Air Force, and Airmen. He led the biggest changes to both systems since their inception in 1970, ensuring job performance was the greatest factor towards promotion. <!-- Page 614 -->

THE USAF SONG LYRICS
Verse I: Off we go into the wild blue yonder, Climbing high into the sun; Here they come zooming to meet our thunder, At ‘em now, Give ’em the gun! Down we dive, spouting our flame from under, Off with one helluva roar! We live in fame or go down in flame. Hey! Nothing’ll stop the U.S. Air Force!! Verse II: Brilliant minds fashioned a crate of thunder, Sent it high into the blue; Valiant hands blasted the world asunder; How they lived God only knew! Boundless souls dreaming of skies to conquer Gave us wings, ever to soar! With scouts before and bombers galore. Hey! Nothing’ll stop the U.S. Air Force! Verse III: Here’s a toast to the host
Of those who love the vastness of the sky, To a friend we send a message of the brave who serve on high. We drink to those who gave their
all of old, Then down we roar to score the rainbow’s pot of gold. A toast to the host of those we boast, the
U.S. Air Force! Verse IV: Off we go into the wild sky yonder, Keep the wings level and true; If you’d live to be a grey-haired wonder Keep the nose out of the blue! Fly to fight, guarding the nation’s border, We’ll be there, followed by more! In echelon we carry on. Oh, nothing’ll stop the U.S. Air Force!
