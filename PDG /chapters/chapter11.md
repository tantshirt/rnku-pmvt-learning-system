### Programs, Benefits, and Services
The USAF requires military members to be prepared to serve and support the mission at all times. To do this, there are a wide range of benefits and services to ensure military members and families
are cared for, whether through pay and entitlements processes, family support programs, or secured
military records. Throughout our careers, we as Airmen need to understand the benefits and
services applicable to ourselves, as well as to subordinates, peers, and leaders in our chain of
command. We need to take responsibility for ourselves and serve as good wingmen for others. 11.2. Information Accessibility
In 2000, the USAF launched the Air Force Portal to simplify the way Airmen access information
and improve the way we do business. The portal provides a single point of entry to web-based
information, self-service applications, collaboration and networking tools, and combat support
systems, many without requiring a separate user identification and password. Access to the portal
is available from any internet-connected computer with a valid Department of Defense public key
infrastructure certificate, such as a common access card. Through the portal, users have access to
myPay, Air Force Virtual Education Center, MyFitness, Virtual Military Personnel Flight, LeaveWeb, Assignment Management System, and the Air Force E-Publishing Website. On the
Library and Resources link, users can access online periodicals, research information, and find
valuable education and training materials. 11.3. Military and Family Readiness Center
Military and Family Readiness Center (M&FRC) support services are designed to assist
commanders in assessing and supporting the welfare of the military and building a strong sense of
community and support within the USAF. The M&FRC supports mission readiness by helping
Airmen and their families adapt to the challenges and demands of expeditionary operations and
the military lifestyle. M&FRCs coordinate with unit leadership to assess unit strengths, resources, and concerns to help identify issues and trends that affect community readiness and personal
preparedness by working with a wide range of civilian and military agencies. M&FRCs provide
support for work/life issues and facilitate community readiness, resilience, and personal
preparedness. Services offered by the M&FRC are briefly described here. Personal and Work Life Program. The Personal and Work Life Program promotes community
wellness and assists with the readiness and resiliency of the force. Services include intervention, prevention/enrichment consultation, and skill building education designed to enhance work-life
competencies for individuals, couples, and families. Focus is on promotion, enrichment, and
improvement of the balance between work and home to increase quality of life and resilience. Commander’s Key Support Program (CKSP). The CKSP is an official unit family readiness
program designed to enhance readiness and establish a sense of community. This Commander’s
program promotes partnerships with the unit, the M&FRC, and community agencies. <!-- Page 203 -->

Military and Family Readiness Centers (M&FRC)—Transition Assistance Program. The
Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is congressionally mandated and executed by the M&FRC
to provide Service members with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions, be
competitive in a global workforce, and be positive contributors to their community as they
transition and reintegrate into civilian life. TAP has multiple components which must be
completed prior to separation, retirement, or release from active duty: Individualized Initial
Counseling, Pre-separation Counseling both required to be completed No Later Than (NLT) 365
days prior to separation, retirement, or release from active duty. Core Curriculum which includes
DoD Day, Department of Labor Employment Fundamentals of Career Training and Veterans
Affairs Benefits and Services workshops, at least one 2-day track from the following options: Employment, Education, Vocational, or Entrepreneurship and Capstone NLT 90 days prior to
separation, retirement, or release from active duty which includes verification of transition plan
and applicable required Career Readiness Standard deliverables. Volunteer Resources. The Volunteer Resources Program collaborates with other base agencies
for the purpose of referring Airmen, Guardians, spouses, and other family members for volunteer
opportunities. Through this program, volunteers may be recognized by the Air Force Volunteer
Excellence Award (VEA), a Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) level award. The VEA is a
commander’s program to recognize volunteer contributions in the local civilian community or
military family community. Military Family Life Counselors. The Department of Defense-contracted Military Family Life
Counselor Program provides Airmen and their dependents with confidential assistance for nonmedical, short-term, solution focused counseling and briefings that augment counseling services
provided by other agencies. Exceptional Family Member Program. The Exceptional Family Member Program provides
coordination of family support services on and off the installation to exceptional family members
who have physical, developmental, emotional, or intellectual impairments or disabilities. Three
components of support are medical, assignments, and family. Air Force Families Forever. Air Force Families Forever facilitates long-term case management
procedures and provides support for surviving family members of deceased Regular Air Force, U.S. Space Force, and Air Reserve Component, Airmen, and Guardians who died in an Active
Duty, Inactive Duty for Training, or Annual Training status and whose relationship was
established prior to the Airman/Guardian’s death. Voting Assistance Program. The Voting Assistance Program ensures service members and their
families understand their right to vote via absentee ballot. M&FRC staff operate the Installation
Voter Assistance Office and serve as Voting Assistance Officers, responsible for providing
accurate nonpartisan voting information and assistance. More information about the Voting
Assistance Program can be found in DAFI 36-3107, Voting Assistance Program. Deployment Briefings. Personnel and family readiness pre-deployment briefings are mandatory
for individuals with a firm deployment tasking of 30 or more days. The briefings educate Airmen, Guardians, and their families on all phases of deployment and critical aspects of reunion and
reintegration. Spouses are welcome and encouraged to attend. The briefings include information
on preparing for deployment; sustainment, support, and services for family members including
extended family; and mandatory reintegration briefings and continuing services that help Airmen
and Guardians prepare for reuniting with their families, friends, and communities, and for
handling combat stressors. Employment Assistance. Employment assistance supports Airmen and their families in achieving
<!-- Page 204 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
204
short- and long-term employment, referral for education and training, and development of career
goals through employment skills counseling and skills development workshops to prepare
customers for careers in the private and public sectors. They also offer resources for selfemployment, information on small business and entrepreneurial opportunities, and links to
alternatives to paid employment, such as volunteerism and education. Personal Financial Readiness Services. Personal financial readiness is an M&FRC program that
offers information, education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals and families
maintain financial stability and reach their financial goals. The program provides education to all
personnel throughout the entire military life cycle. Mandatory financial readiness training is
offered through the M&FRC by certified financial counselors. In addition to the mandatory
training, Airmen and Guardians and their families can also learn financial basics such as
budgeting, credit, large purchases, state or country liability laws, and local fraudulent business
practices. Personal financial readiness services are free. Military Child Education. Civilian and military school liaison officers partner to provide
information, referrals, resources, and advocacy for the educational needs of military-connected
students by assisting Airmen and families regarding local school districts and other educational
options, as well as educating school personnel on the unique issues impacting military children. Relocation Assistance. Relocation assistance provides pre-departure and post-arrival services, allowing members to make informed decisions and preparations for their moves. Referrals will
include, but are not limited to temporary housing services, government or private home finding
services, child care, medically-related services, spouse employment assistance, cultural and
community orientation, schooling, legal assistance, personal property shipment, and information
on educational and volunteer opportunities. Crisis Support. Crisis support provides immediate, short-term information and referral to
appropriate agencies or services to assist individuals and families facing crisis situations with
support to the community before, during and after disaster, crisis, and or evacuation situations. Casualty Assistance. Casualty Assistance Representatives (CAR) and survivor benefit plan
counselors provide assistance and counseling on benefits offered by a wide variety of programs
from the Department of the Air Force, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security
Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Health and Human Services, as well as
state and local agencies. When a casualty occurs, the USAF will promptly notify the Primary Next
of Kin (PNOK) and other named beneficiaries as appropriate based on a member’s casualty status, in a dignified, professional, and timely manner. Additionally, in cases where the military member
is declared deceased, Duty Status Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), or missing, the USAF
appoints a CAR to advise and assist the PNOK and beneficiaries you have identified. The CAR
assists to meet very important timelines, such as delivering notifications within 12 hours of a
casualty. Therefore, when an Airman’s Record of Emergency Data (RED) is current and has upto-date information, NOK and beneficiaries receive timely notifications. As a result, the RED and
the Servicemembers’ Online Election System (SOES) mentioned below are critically important
for each Airman to understand, review, verify, and certify that they are up-to-date at least once a
year or when a beneficiary’s information changes. Emergency Data (DD Form 93). Record of emergency data (RED) maintained initially on the
DD Form 93 and ultimately input into the virtual record of emergency data (vRED) via vMPF
enables Airmen to list those they wish to be notified should they become ill, injured, wounded, missing or deceased. Additionally, Airmen determine beneficiaries of Death Gratuity, Arrears of
Pay, and designate the Person Authorized to Direct Disposition (PADD) of their remains. To
<!-- Page 205 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
205
update your vRED, log into vMPF: Select ‘Personal Data’ and then select ‘Record of Emergency
Data.’ Service members are responsible for entering information, reviewing/submitting annually, or updating their vRED when there are life-changing events such as marriage, divorce, births, before deployments, TDYs more than 30 days, and PCS. For more information go to myFSS and
search, “Record of Emergency Data Associated Benefits.” Note: There is no requirement for the
PADD to be related to the deceased, however, the person you select to be the PADD should be
aware of your wishes and that person should understand that they will be required to make
decisions about what to do with your remains after death (embalming, funeral services, cremation, burial, etc.). Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Online Enrollment System (SOES). SOES is an
enterprise solution developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Veteran Benefits
Administration. SOES is a self-service based data system that centralizes Servicemembers’ Group
Life Insurance (SGLI) and Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) information
into one authoritative system capable of providing consistent information to authorized users. SGLI provides up to $500,000 in life insurance coverage; FSGLI provides up to $100,000 in
coverage for the spouse and $10,000 for dependent children. Service members can use the system
to change the amount of SGLI or FSGLI coverage. You can view, save, print, or email a SGLI
coverage certificate. SOES Enables Airmen
to make automated SGLI and FSGLI
coverage/beneficiary elections 24/7/365. Note: Airmen married to other Airmen (military-tomilitary) who have not updated DEERS with their spouse’s information will not be able to properly
certify their SOES Record. Airmen meeting this criteria must go to their MPF’s Customer Service
Element or the nearest RAPIDS station to add their spouse as a dependent. Please note hard copy
(SGLV Form 8286, Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Election and Certificate) SGLI
elections remain valid until superseded by a SOES election. For more information go to myFSS
Knowledge Article and search Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance, Veterans’ Group Life
Insurance or simply log into SOES via milConnect. Emergency Assistance. When directed by the installation commander, emergency assistance will
be provided through the Emergency Family Assistance Center. Emergency assistance provides
continuous, authoritative, family assistance and services for servicemembers, families, service
providers, leadership, and other stakeholders, which address the practical and emotional needs of
families arising from the incident., Legal Services. Legal offices provide legal assistance in connection with personal civil legal
matters to support and sustain command effectiveness and readiness. The ability to offer legal
assistance and legal services to the eligible categories of personnel is contingent upon the
availability of legal staff resources and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Air Force. Legal services are not performed by or within M&FRCs, this is performed by Office
of the Staff Judge Advocate on the installation. 11.4. Warrior Wellness
Air Force Wounded Warrior Program. The Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2) program
(https://www.woundedwarrior.af.mil/) is a congressionally mandated, federally funded program
that provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously or very seriously wounded, ill, or injured Total Force Airmen/Guardians, their caregivers, and family members. AFW2 also
provides the following support activities: Emergency Family Member Travel, Family Liaison
Officer Program, Caregiver Support Program, Adaptive Sports & Resiliency Programs, Special
Compensation for Assistance with Activities of Daily Living, Recovering Airman Mentorship
Program, Empowerment to Employment, Community Programs, and the Ambassador Program. Anyone may refer an Airman or Guardian to the AFW2 Program by clicking the “Refer an

Airman/Guardian” at the top of the program’s website opening page. 11.5. Family Care Plans
According to AFI 1-1, the USAF must have people in the right place at the right time, ready to
perform the jobs for which they have been trained. Unless specifically deferred or exempted, all
USAF members must be available to perform military duties and assignments, including but not
limited to, permanent change of station or assignment, unaccompanied tours, temporary duty, deployments, alerts, recalls, extended hours, or shift work. Single-member parents with custody
of children who bear sole or joint responsibility, and military couples with dependents, must have
a family care plan. Members who are solely responsible for the care of a spouse, elderly family
member, or adult family member with disabilities who is dependent on the member for financial, medical, or logistical support, must also have a family care plan. This includes family members
who have limited command of the English language, are unable to drive, or unable to gain access
to basic life-sustaining facilities. Suitable arrangements must be planned in advance for a
nonmilitary member to assume custody of dependents in the event the military member is
unavailable to provide dependent care due to military obligations. Family Care Arrangements. Each USAF member must make and maintain dependent care
arrangements that will allow the member to be world-wide deployable at all times. Advance
planning is the key to dependent care arrangements. Every USAF member with dependents must
take the initiative to use all available military and civilian resources, including other-thanimmediate family members, to ensure dependents receive adequate care, support, and supervision
that is compatible with the member’s military duties. Dependent care plans must cover all possible
situations in the short- and long-term and must be sufficiently detailed and systematic for a
smooth, rapid transfer of responsibilities to another individual during the absence of the military
sponsor. Family Care Certification. Commanders or first sergeants counsel all Airmen with family
members on DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908, during inprocessing. During this counseling, commanders or first sergeants must stress the importance of, and confirm the need for, family care
certification by completing DAF Form 357, Family Care Certification. Also, commanders or first
sergeants are required to annually brief all military members with family care responsibilities, individually. During this briefing, the commander or first sergeant signs the AF Form 357 each
time the plan is reviewed and certified, determining the actual workability of the family care plan. The member signs and dates the DAF Form 357 to document that the briefing was completed. In
the event of geographical separation, commanders may delegate responsibility, in writing, to
detachment and operating location chiefs to counsel members and certify the form. The original
signed DAF Form 357 will be filed with the member’s administrative office and a copy will be
sent to the commander for review and filing. Family Care Plan Changes. Members must notify their commander or first sergeant
immediately, or within 30 days (60 days for Selected Reserve) if changes in personal status or
family circumstances require completion of an DAF Form 357. Specific circumstances that may
warrant development of a family care plan are provided in DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908. Note: Failure to produce a family care plan within 60 days of the discussion with the commander, supervisor, or commander’s designated representative may result in disciplinary action or
administrative separation. Duty deferments, primarily for a four-month period, when applicable, are offered to assist USAF military members in developing family care plans and establishing a
pattern of childcare. DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908 provides more detailed information regarding
duty deferments and to whom they may apply. <!-- Page 207 -->

### Veterans Affairs Benefits
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a wide range of benefits to the nation’s veterans, service members, and their families. VA benefits and services fall into the major categories of
disability benefits, education benefits, vocational rehabilitation and employment, home loans, burial benefits, dependents’ and survivors’ benefits, life insurance, and health care. Airmen
requiring specific information on their VA benefits can retrieve information at: www.va.gov or
contact the closest VA department for eligibility requirements. Disability Compensation. Disability compensation is a tax-free monetary benefit paid to veterans
with disabilities that are the result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during RegAF
military service. Compensation may be paid for post-service disabilities that are considered related
or secondary to disabilities occurring in service and for disabilities presumed to be related to
circumstances of military service, even though they may arise after service. The degree of
disability is designed to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or
illnesses. The benefit amount is graduated according to the degree of the veteran's disability on a
scale from 10 percent to 100 percent (in increments of 10 percent). If you have dependents, an
additional allowance may be added if your combined disability is rated 30 percent or greater. Compensation may be offset if you receive military retirement pay, disability severance pay, or
separation incentive payments. Educational Benefits. The VA offers a variety of educational benefits to service members and
veterans to pursue a higher education during or following their service. Benefit programs include
the Post-9/11 GI Bill, Montgomery GI Bill, Reserve Educational Assistance Program, and
Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance. The Yellow Ribbon GI Education
Enhancement Program is a provision of the Public Law 110-252, Post-9/11 Veterans Educational
Assistance Act of 2008. Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment. Airmen may receive services to help with job
training, employment accommodations, resume development, and job seeking skills coaching
through the VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program. Additional services may be
provided to assist veterans in starting their own businesses or independent living services for those
who are severely disabled and unable to work in traditional employment. Home Loans. The VA helps service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses become
homeowners by providing a home loan guaranty benefit and other housing-related programs to
help Airmen buy, build, repair, retain, or adapt a home for their own personal occupancy. VA
home loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. VA
guarantees a portion of the loan, enabling the lender to provide you with more favorable terms. Burial Benefits. The VA National Cemetery Administration operates 155 national cemeteries
providing burial space for eligible Active-Duty, Retirees, Veterans, and eligible dependents. Burial benefits include gravesite, opening and closing of grave, perpetual care, and a government
headstone or marker at no cost or obligation to the family. In addition, a burial flag and
presidential memorial certificate may be given at no cost or obligation after submitting a
completed application to the VA. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. Dependency and indemnity compensation is a taxfree monetary benefit generally payable to a surviving spouse, child, or parent of service members, or to survivors of veterans who died from their service-connected disabilities. Dependency and
indemnity compensation is an income-based benefit for parents who were financially dependent
on a service member or veteran who died from a service-related cause. <!-- Page 208 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Life Insurance. The VA provides valuable life insurance benefits to give service members and
veterans the peace of mind that comes with knowing their family is protected. The VA life
insurance programs were developed to provide financial security for service member families
given the extraordinary risks involved in military service. 11.7. Veterans’ Health Administration
The transition from receiving care within the military healthcare system into the Veterans Health
Administration can be challenging and sometimes confusing. Military health care, known as
TRICARE, is operated through the Department of Defense and provides medical care for service
members and their dependents. The Veterans Health Administration provides health care for
enrolled veterans and their eligible family members through a network of hospitals and clinics
across the country. TRICARE and the Veterans Health Administration work together, but have
different eligibility criteria, health benefits, and costs. TRICARE Program. TRICARE is the worldwide health care program serving uniformed service
members and retirees, their family members, survivors, and some former spouses entitled to
TRICARE benefits. TRICARE programs are also available to Air Reserve Component members
and their families. TRICARE is a force multiplier for the military health system that fills gaps in
military health care using networks of civilian health care professionals, facilities, pharmacies, and
suppliers. These civilian networks help enable the Department of Defense to provide beneficiaries
with access to high-quality health care services even while uniformed medics are serving abroad
in contingency operations. TRICARE is available in the United States and overseas. Each
TRICARE region has a managed care support contractor that administers and coordinates health
care services with network and non-network civilian hospitals and providers. Comprehensive, current information on TRICARE plans and programs can be found at the TRICARE website
(https://www.tricare.mil/). TRICARE Plans. Several TRICARE health plan options are available to eligible beneficiaries. The primary health care options offered to eligible beneficiaries are TRICARE Prime and
TRICARE Select. Availability of the plans depends on the sponsor’s military status and residence. Variations of TRICARE Prime are available, such as TRICARE Prime Remote, TRICARE Prime
Overseas, and TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas. Variations of TRICARE Select are available, such as TRICARE Select and TRICARE Select Overseas. Additional plans available include
TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Young
Adult, and U.S. Family Health Plan. The TRICARE plan finder can be used to determine the best
plan available (https://www.tricare.mil/Plans/PlanFinder). TRICARE Dental Plans. TRICARE offers three dental plans, each with its own dental contractor. The three plans include the active duty dental program, the TRICARE dental program, and the
TRICARE retiree dental program. 11.8. Retirement Benefits
Enlisted members are eligible to retire if they have 20 years of Total Active Federal Military
Service (TAFMS) and there are no restrictions per DAFI 36-3203, Service Retirements. Enlisted
members must apply for retirement, otherwise they will separate on their date of separation. Officers must have 20 years of TAFMS and 10 years of total active federal commissioned service
to be eligible to retire. Waivers to Retire. DAFI 36-3203, Tables 3.1 and 3.2, identify restrictions to retirement. Some
restrictions, such as not completing an active duty service commitment, may be waived if the
member can provide sufficient justification to show the waiver is in the best interest of the USAF
<!-- Page 209 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
209
or that the member is experiencing an extreme personal hardship uncommon to other military
members. Not all waivers are approved, so applicants should include detailed evidence to support
their requests. Application Submission. A retirement application can typically be submitted through the myFSS
website up to 12 months, but no less than 4 months before the desired retirement date. Airmen
applying for retirement under the 7-day or 3-day option program may be able to submit an
application more than 12 months in advance. DAFI 36-2110, Chapters 5 and 7, outline information
on those programs and the applicable exceptions. Before submitting any application, the member
must request an eligibility review through the myFSS website. The system will provide an
automated response of the member’s retirement eligibility status and identify any restrictions or
waiverable conditions at the time of submission. After receiving the eligibility results, the member
may submit their application through the on-line submission process in myFSS. Place of Retirement. In general, a member retires at the current duty station and may travel to a
home of selection anywhere in the United States. If the member is overseas, the member retires at
that location when outprocessing facilities exist, and the member and family proceed to the final
home of selection. When outprocessing facilities do not exist at the overseas location, the member
may request travel to a separation processing base in the United States. If the member elects to
retire overseas and live permanently in that country, he or she must comply with command and
host government residency rules before the date of retirement. Retirement Pay Plans. The Date Initially Entered Uniformed Service (DIEUS) normally
determines which retirement pay plan applies to a member. DIEUS is the date an individual was
initially enlisted, inducted, or appointed in a Regular or Reserve Component of a uniformed service
as a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member. The DIEUS is a fixed date that is
not subject to adjustment because of a break in service. Current RegAF personnel will fall under
one of the retirement plans described in Table 11.1. Retirement Plan

REDUX cost of living adjustments
for later years will continue to be
Consumer Price Index minus 1%. Full inflation protection based on
Consumer Price Index. 1. “Date entered service” means the date the person is enlisted, inducted, or appointed with the Armed Forces. This
includes persons in the Delayed Entry Program, cadets at Service Academies, officer candidates in Officer Training
School, students enrolled in an ARC in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs or other financial assistance
programs, students in the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and persons in the Armed Forces
Health Professions Scholarship program. By using “date entered service,” Active Component members have been
“grandfathered” under the plan in effect at the time when the member initially entered the service. 2. The maximum multiplier for 30 years TAFMS is 75% times the retired pay base; however, members who serve
beyond 30 years earn an additional 2.5% each additional year and can max out at 100%. 3. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act allows state courts to consider retired pay as divisible
property in divorce settlements. The law does not direct state courts to divide retired pay; it simply permits them to
do so. 4. Retired pay stops upon the death of the retiree. 5. Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in the officer’s highest grade (Title 10 USC Section
1370) will be paid based on the retired grade (Title 10 USC Section 1407f). Officers retiring in an enlisted grade will
have the member’s pay calculated as determined by Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS). 6. Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in the officer's highest grade (Title 10 USC Section
1370) will be paid based on the last 36-month average of the time served in the higher grade and the time served in
the lower grade. Exception: Does not apply to officers who did not serve satisfactorily in the highest grade and such
determination is the result of conduct occurring after 30 October 2000 (See Note 5). 7. Enlisted members demoted to a lower grade within three years and retired in that grade will not be paid based on
the high 36-month average in the higher grades. The member’s retired pay will be calculated using the multiplier
percentage determined by the applicable retirement plan (High-3, REDUX or BRS) and the retirement pay base will
<!-- Page 211 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
211
be calculated under final basic pay rate for the lower grade. When an enlisted member’s active service added to
retired list service totals 30 years, the member may be advanced (on the retired list) and receive retired pay in the
highest grade satisfactorily held on AD, as determined by the SecAF or designee (Title 10 USC Section 9344). 8. Officers who resign officer commissions and retire in enlisted status will have retired pay calculated in accordance
with Title 10 USC Section 1407e. DFAS is required to calculate the high-36 month average as if the member held
the retired grade for the last 36 months of active service. 9. Members entering the service prior to 1 January 2018, who have less than 12 years of service (calculated from the
pay date) or less than 4,320 retirement points (for ARC members) as of 31 December 2017, may enroll in the BRS. 10. Members in the Delayed Entry Program, cadets at Service Academies, officer candidates in Officer Training
School, students enrolled in an ARC in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs, entering the service prior
to 1 January 2018, may enroll in the BRS following commissioning/accession into AD. Members commissioned or
accessed AD after 2 December 2018 have 30 days from commissioning/entry into AD to enroll in the BRS. 11. Members with breaks in service reentering AD or the selected reserve on or after 1 January 2019, who originally
entered the service prior to 1 January 2018, and have less than 12 years of service (calculated from the pay date) or
less than 4,320 retirement points for ARC members as of reentry, may enroll in the BRS within 30 days of reentry. 12. Members enrolled in the BRS will have a Thrift Savings Plan established that includes automatic and matching
government contributions. DoD begins an automatic contribution of one percent of base pay after 60 days of service
(calculated from pay date). DoD begins matching contributions up to an additional four percent of base pay after 2
years of service (calculated from pay date). Automatic and matching contributions continue until the member
separates, retires, or completes 26 years of service (calculated from pay date). For members enrolling in BRS as
outlined in Notes 9 through 11, government contributions begin the pay period following enrollment. 13. Airmen retiring under the BRS are eligible to elect a lump sum payment of a portion of the Airman’s retirement
pay. Requests for the lump sum election are documented on the DD Form 2656, Data for Payment of Retired
Personnel, and must be submitted to the retirement approval authority no later than 90 days prior to the Airman’s
retirement effective date for regular retirement or the date upon which the Airman first becomes eligible to receive
retired pay under the non-regular retirement program. The retirement approval authority will notify the Airman of
the lump sum election at the time of retirement application or 90 days prior to the Airman’s eligibility to receive
retired pay. Airmen have the option of receiving the lump sum payment in up to four annual installments. Acceptance
of the lump sum payment does not impact an Airman’s eligibility to elect Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP); however, there may be required offsets or other considerations related to disability pay and other benefits from the Department
of Veterans’ Affairs. Airmen should seek counseling from the Military and Family Readiness Center (M&FRC) prior
to election. Table 11.1. Retirement Pay Plans. 11.9. Survivor Benefit Plan
Military pay stops when a member dies. The survivor benefit plan provides a monthly income to
survivors of retired military personnel upon the member’s death. The survivor benefit plan is a
government program for retiring members to ensure their eligible survivors receive a portion of
their military retired pay as a monthly annuity after their death. The plan was structured so a
surviving spouse cannot outlive the annuity, and cost-of-living adjustments are incorporated to
offset inflation. RegAF members with a spouse or dependent children are automatically covered
by the survivor benefit plan at no cost while they remain on RegAF status. The member’s death must be classified in ‘line of duty’ for an annuity to be payable if the member
is not yet retirement eligible (has not accrued 20 years of RegAF status) on the date of death. The
annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if
retired with a total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable if the
member’s death is classified ‘not in line of duty’ as long as the member was retirement eligible on
the date of death. In this case, annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would
<!-- Page 212 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
212
have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on the date of death. The surviving
spouse of a member who dies in the line of duty while on RegAF status may request the survivor
benefit plan be paid only to the member’s children, avoiding the reduction caused by a spouse’s
receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation, the survivor benefits paid by the VA when a
member’s death is determined to have resulted from a service-connected cause. The survivor benefit plan is the only program that enables a portion of military retired pay to be
paid to a member’s survivors. Prior to retiring, each member must decide whether to continue
survivor benefit plan coverage into retirement. If electing coverage, survivor benefit plan
premiums are assessed and automatically deducted from the member’s monthly retired pay. Premiums are government-subsidized and deducted from a participating member’s retired pay
before taxes. Survivor benefit plan premiums and beneficiary annuity payments depend on what is called the
“base amount” elected as the basis of coverage. A service member’s base amount can be the full
monthly retired pay or a portion of retired pay, down to $300. Full coverage means full retired pay
is elected as the base amount. The base amount is tied to a member’s retired pay; therefore, when
retired pay receives cost-of-living adjustments, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do
premiums and annuity payments. Under limited circumstances, Airmen may withdraw from the survivor benefit plan or change
coverage. As a survivor benefit plan participant, individuals have a one-year window to terminate
survivor benefit plan coverage between the second and third anniversary following the date
beginning receipt of retired pay. The premiums paid will not be refunded, and an annuity will not
be payable upon death. The covered spouse or former spouse must consent to the withdrawal. Termination is permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any circumstance barring
future enrollment. The survivor benefit plan also has a “paid-up” feature that permits members
who have attained age 70, and who have paid survivor benefit plan premiums for 360 months, to
stop paying premiums but remain active participants in the plan. 11.10. American Red Cross
The American Red Cross (https://www.redcross.org/) offers unwavering commitment, free of
charge, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, to members of the U.S. Armed Forces, veterans, and
their families, to include: RegAF, National Guard, Reservists, Reserve Officer Training Corps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Public Health Service. Red Cross
support enhances morale and contributes to increased operational capability by linking military
families during an emergency, connecting families with local community resources, providing
resiliency training, and supporting wounded warriors and military hospitals, non-Federal entity
program, service, or award. The Red Cross toll free number for service members and families in
the United States is: 1-800-733-2767. Military members and family members overseas may call
base or installation operators or the American Red Cross office at the overseas location. Note: For the American Red Cross to provide expedient service, provide as much of the following
information available as possible: full name, rank/rating, branch of service, social security number
or date of birth, military address, and information about the deployed unit and home base unit (for
deployed service members only). Emergency Communication Services. When a military family experiences a crisis, the American
Red Cross is there to assist by providing emergency communications. The Red Cross relays urgent
messages containing accurate, factual, complete, and verified descriptions of the emergency to
service members stationed anywhere in the world, including ships at sea, embassies, and remote
locations. Red Cross-verified information assists commanders in making decisions regarding
<!-- Page 213 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
213
emergency leave. Financial Assistance. The American Red Cross works under partnership agreements with the Air
Force Aid Society, Army Emergency Relief, Coast Guard Mutual Assistance, and Navy-Marine
Corps Relief Society to provide quality, reliable financial assistance to eligible applicants. Types
of assistance include financial assistance for emergency travel, burial of a loved one, and assistance
to avoid privation or hardship. Coping with Deployments. The psychological first aid course was designed specifically for
spouses, parents, siblings, and significant others of service members. This Red Cross service
provides useful information on how to strengthen the ability to successfully respond to challenges
that military family members may encounter throughout the deployment cycle. The course also
explains how to provide psychological first aid to others experiencing stressful feelings or events. Reconnection Workshops. The reconnection workshops are designed for reintegration support
for working through anger, communicating clearly, exploring stress and trauma, relating to
children, and identifying depression. The workshops focus on individuals and small groups to help
family members reconnect and help service members reintegrate successfully. Led by licensed, specifically trained Red Cross mental health workers, each session addresses a topic military
family have found relevant to the reunion adjustment. Veterans Claims for Benefits. The American Red Cross provides assistance and information in
preparing, developing, and obtaining sufficient evidence to support applicants’ claims for veterans’
benefits, and also assists claimants who seek to appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Information and Referral Services. The American Red Cross offers confidential services to all
military personnel and their families. Counseling, guidance, information, referrals, and other social
services are available through the worldwide network of chapters and offices on military
installations. As more and more National Guard and Reserve units are called to full-time duty
status, counseling has become increasingly important to prepare the civilian-based military
members and their families for the period of activation. 11.11. Recruiting Programs
Airmen of all ranks can have a positive impact on recruiting and help recruiters make contacts and
develop leads. (RAP)
Recruiter Assistance Programs. The Recruiter Assistance
(http://www.recruiting.af.mil/) is a RegAF leave program, run by the Air Force Recruiting
Service, where an Airman or Guardian directly supports a USAF or USSF recruiter. Members
may request non-chargeable leave in accordance with DAFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. RAP is beneficial to the DAF and to participants as Airmen and Guardians can be major influences
in sharing the USAF or USSF story to their hometown or place of previous residence. RAP duties
may include question-and-answer sessions, making presentations, or providing testimonials of
their USAF or USSF experiences to high school and college students. Program
We Are All Recruiters. The We Are All Recruiters
program
(https://www.recruiting.af.mil/) may grant Airmen or Guardians permissive temporary duty status
if they participate in an event that directly enhances the recruiting mission. All Airmen and
Guardians, regardless of their USAF or USSF specialty, are recruiters. A WEAR event is an event
where the interaction of USAF or USSF personnel educates and increases public awareness of the
DAF and could potentially generate interest in new recruits. (WEAR)
<!-- Page 214 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
214
Approval for WEAR is limited to those events where Airmen and Guardians are directly speaking
to potential applicants or influencers about USAF or USSF opportunities. Applicants are defined
as individuals within the age range of 17 to 39. Influencers are defined as parents, community
leaders, teachers, counselors, or coaches. For events where multiple Airmen are attending, each
attendee must submit a package for approval. WEAR requests must be first approved by the
individual’s commander in accordance with DAFI 36-3003. Requests are then routed to the Air
Force Recruiting Service Public Affairs office via e-mail: afrshqpa@us.af.mil. Members may
request permissive temporary duty to attend a WEAR event. Visit the AF Recruiting Service
website (https://www.recruiting.af.mil/) to review the WEAR Fact Sheet, and download the

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**

Chapter 11—PERSONNEL PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
## Section 11B — Leave and Authorized Absences B B C C C

### Leave Management
Annual leave programs/plans give members the opportunity to take leave within the constraints of
operational requirements. Unit commanders establish leave programs and plans to encourage the
use of leave for the maximum benefit of the member. Lengthy respites from the work environment
tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and physical status. Therefore, an
effective leave program is an essential military requirement. Processing Leave Requests. LeaveWeb is an automated method of requesting and processing
leave. Under LeaveWeb, the member requests leave which generates an e-mail to the leave
approval authority, as determined by the member’s commander. While commanders have final
approval authority, they may delegate this authority according to the needs of the organization, normally no lower than the first-line supervisor. The leave approval authority approves or
disapproves the leave and, if approved, LeaveWeb sends the request to the unit leave monitor for
validation. Once validated, the leave request is sent electronically to finance. The member prints a
copy of the approved leave form to hand-carry during leave. Upon returning from leave, the
member completes the necessary updates in LeaveWeb and forwards the e-mail to the leave
approval authority for endorsement. In the event LeaveWeb is unavailable, appropriate procedures
may require use of the DAF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization. 11.13. Beginning and Ending Leave
Leave must begin and end in the local area. The term “local area” means the place of residence
from which the member commutes to the duty station on a daily basis. This also applies to leave
enroute to a permanent change of station or temporary duty (TDY) assignment. The old permanent
duty station is for beginning leave and the new permanent duty station is for ending leave. When
members take leave enroute with permanent change of station or TDY travel, the financial service
office uses the travel voucher to determine authorized travel and chargeable leave. Nonduty days
and holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of leave. If leave
includes a weekend, a member cannot end leave on a Friday and begin leave again on Monday. Further, unit commanders will not approve successive Monday through Friday leaves (or periods
of leave surrounding other nonduty days) except under emergency or unusual circumstances, as
determined by the unit commander. Extensions and Recalls. When an extension of leave is desired, the member must ask, orally or
in writing, for an extension of leave. The extension must be requested sufficiently in advance of
expiration of leave authorized to permit the member to return to duty at the proper time if the
approval authority disapproves the extension. Unit commanders may recall members from leave
for military necessity or in the best interest of the USAF. Refer to the Joint Travel Regulation to
determine if travel and transportation allowances apply. If the unit commander authorizes the
member to resume leave after the member completes the duty that resulted in recall, a new DAF
Form 988 or orders must be prepared. 11.14. Accruing Leave
Members accrue 2.5 days leave for each month of RegAF status. Members do not earn leave when
they are absent without official leave, in an unauthorized leave status, in confinement as a result
of a court-martial sentence, in an excess leave status, or on appellate leave. Members may
<!-- Page 216 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
216
accumulate a maximum of 60 days by the end of a fiscal year. There are certain circumstances
when a leave balance of more than 60 days may be carried forward into a new fiscal year, but only
when specifically authorized. By law, members may receive accrued leave payment up to a
maximum of 60 days at certain points in their careers, such as reenlistment, retirement, separation
under honorable conditions, or death. Department of Defense policy encourage members to use
leave to relax from the pressures of duties and not as a method of compensation. 11.15. Types of Leave
DAFI 36-3003, outlines many types of leave, as briefly described here. Annual Leave. Another name for “ordinary” leave is annual leave. Normally, members use annual
leave to take vacations, attend to family needs, celebrate traditional holidays, attend significant
events, or as terminal leave with retirement or separation from RegAF status. Advance Leave. Advance leave is granted based on a reasonable expectation that a member will
accrue at least the amount of leave being requested during the remaining period of RegAF status. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to resolve emergencies or urgent situations
when they have limited or no accrued leave. When a member has taken all the advance leave that
represents what he or she will accrue during the remaining period of RegAF service, commanders
change the member’s leave status from advance to excess leave. Bereavement Leave. Bereavement Leave is a period of non-chargeable paid leave to make
arrangements required by the death of a member’s spouse or child and to attend the funeral, burial, or memorial service of the spouse or child. A member who experiences such a loss will be allowed
up to 14 days of leave to be used in connection with the death. The member must have less than
## days of accrued ordinary leave on the date of such death to be eligible for bereavement leave. Excess Leave. Excess leave is normally used for personal or family emergency situations when
members cannot request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, entitlement to
pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on the member’s first day of excess leave. If injured, a member will not receive disability pay for time spent on excess leave. The period of excess leave
will not count toward fulfillment of RegAF duty service commitment. The member will be
charged for each day of excess leave used and an additional half day for every 6 days of negative
leave. Convalescent Leave. Convalescent leave is an authorized absence normally for the minimal time
needed to meet the medical needs for recuperation. A member of the armed forces diagnosed with
a medical condition is allowed convalescent leave if the medical or behavioral health provider of
the member determines that the member is not yet fit for duty as a result of that condition and
recommends such leave for the member to provide for the convalescence of the member from that
condition. This may include convalescence to enable healthy coping mechanisms following
traumatic events such as loss of a child due to stillbirth or miscarriage where other types of nonchargeable leave are not authorized. The Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG) oversees the
convalescent leave program in accordance with AFMAN 41-210, Tricare Operations and Patient
Administration. Emergency Leave. Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for emergencies involving
members of the immediate family. Unit commanders approve emergency leave and can delegate
leave approval to no lower than the first sergeant for enlisted personnel. The official granting leave
may request assistance from the military service activity nearest the location of the emergency or, when necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial period of emergency leave is usually
no more than 30 days with a possible 30-day extension with approval from the unit commander or
<!-- Page 217 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
217
first sergeant. Unit commanders should advise members to apply for a humanitarian or exceptional
family member reassignment or hardship discharge if the leave period is more than 60 days. Emergency Leave of Absence (Non-Chargeable Leave). Emergency Leave of Absence allows
commanders or civilian directors to grant up to 14 days of non-chargeable leave for a qualifying
emergency such as a serious medical condition of an immediate family member of the service
member, death of an immediate family member as defined in DAFI 36-3003, paragraph 3.1.3.1, or any other hardship the commander or director determines appropriate. The leave is granted
once during an entire career and is only used to prevent the service member from entering an
advanced or excess leave status. Enroute Leave. Enroute leave is ordinary leave used during a permanent change of station. Normally, the losing unit commander approves up to 30 days enroute leave with any change of
station move if it does not interfere with the reporting date of the new assignment. Members who
complete basic or technical training may request 10 days of leave enroute if their first duty station
is in the Continental United States, or 14 days for an overseas assignment. Members may request
advance leave when they do not have enough leave accrued for enroute leave. Terminal Leave. Terminal leave is chargeable leave taken in conjunction with retirement or
separation from RegAF status. The member’s last day of leave coincides with the last day of
RegAF status. Normally, a member does not return to duty after terminal leave begins. The amount
of leave taken cannot exceed the leave balance at the date of separation. Environmental and Morale Leave. Environmental and morale leave is authorized overseas
where adverse environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in desirable places
at periodic intervals. Funded environmental and morale leave is charged as ordinary leave and
members are authorized military transportation (travel time is not charged as leave). Unfunded
environmental and morale leave is charged as ordinary leave and members are authorized spaceavailable air transportation to and from the duty locations (travel time is charged as leave). Military Parental Leave Program. Military Parental Leave Program authorizes 12 weeks of
non-chargeable leave to covered service members after a qualifying birth event, adoption of a
minor child or who have a minor child placed for adoption or long-term foster care with them to
care for the child. 11.16. Permissive Temporary Duty
Permissive TDY is an administrative absence for which funded TDY is not appropriate. Commanders may not authorize permissive TDY in place of leave or a special pass or in
conjunction with special passes. Permissive TDY, if authorized, may include traveling to or in the
vicinity of a new permanent duty station to secure off-base housing, accompanying a military or
dependent patient to a designated medical treatment facility not in the local area, attending a
Department of Defense sponsored assistance seminar under the Transition Assistance Program, or
attending national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations. 11.17. Regular and Special Passes
A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short amount of time. There are
no mileage restrictions; however, members may be expected to return to duty within a reasonable
time due to an operational mission requirement, such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency. Regular Pass. A regular pass normally begins at the end of work hours on Friday afternoon and
continues until the beginning of normal work hours on the following Monday when non-duty days
are Saturday and Sunday. A regular pass period on non-traditional work schedules (alternate or
<!-- Page 218 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
218
compressed schedules) may not exceed the four-day special pass limit. The combination of nonduty days and a public holiday may not exceed the four-day special pass limit. The combination
of three non-duty days and a public holiday during a compressed work schedule is a regular pass
period. Department of Defense or higher management may determine that a Monday or Friday is
compensatory (comp) time off when a holiday is observed on a Tuesday or Thursday, in which
case a regular pass may consist of a weekend, a comp day off, and a public holiday. Special Pass. Unit commanders may award three- or four-day special passes for special occasions, circumstances, special recognition, or compensatory time off. Commanders may delegate approval
to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start
after normal work hours on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal work hours on either
the fourth day for a three-day special pass or the fifth day for a four-day special pass. <!-- Page 219 -->

### Military and Community Associations
Being a member of the U.S. Armed Forces means being a part of one of the biggest communities
in the world. The greater military community includes RegAF, National Guard and Reserve, retirees, and veterans, as well as spouses and family members. There are a large number of military
associations devoted to serving different segments of the community for lobbying efforts, fraternity, and support. The USAF and its personnel can endorse the following activities per Joint
Ethics Regulation (JER), Section 3-210, Activities with Non-Federal Entities: Fundraising and
Membership Drives: 1. The Combined Federal Campaign. 2. Emergency and disaster appeals approved by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). 3. The Air Force Assistance Fund to include: Air Force Enlisted Village; Air Force Aid
Society; and General and Mrs. Curtis E. LeMay Foundation. 4. Other organizations composed primarily of DoD employees or their dependents when
fundraising among their own members for the benefit of welfare funds for their own members
or their dependents when approved by the head of the DoD Component command or
organization after consultation with the Designated Agency Ethics Official. 5. Veterans Service Organizations (recognized by VA). 6. Installation-recognized Private Organizations (per AFI 34-223, Private Organizations

### Civilian Personnel Programs
The USAF provides civilian personnel services through installation civilian personnel flights
(usually located in the force support squadron) and Air Force Personnel Center. Civilian personnel
sections must provide service to all civilian employees to ensure they are included in the USAF
civilian personnel program unless otherwise approved through HAF. 11.20. Position Descriptions
Civilian employees do not have a rank. Instead, the positions they occupy are graded, typically
under the General Schedule, based upon detailed written job descriptions that are the basis for
determining the pay, qualification requirements, performance expectations, and appraisal ratings
the position. Position descriptions historically have covered duties, associated with
responsibilities, and supervisory controls. The USAF has expanded the scope of core personnel
documents to include qualifications required for recruitment and training requirements for new
employees. Supervisors are responsible for core personnel document accuracy and implementation
of standard core personnel documents. By selecting standard core personnel documents, supervisors save time for themselves and classification specialists who would need to work with
the manager on writing the duties and determining the correct pay plan and occupational series. Standard core personnel documents can be used as templates for unique core personnel documents
requiring new classification analysis. 11.21. Filling Jobs
Vacant civilian positions are filled based on an organization’s needs using a variety of recruitment
sources and appointing authorities consistent with applicable laws, regulations, directives, and
policies, as established by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of
Defense, and the USAF. Referral and selection priorities must be observed when filling
competitive service positions. Employees with mandatory selection or priority referral rights
normally include those adversely affected by reduction-in-force, involuntary separation, demotion, transfer of function declinations or transfer of work outside the commuting area, overseas returnees, and the spouses of military personnel. Supervisors work in concert with their servicing human
resource specialist in the civilian personnel sections or Air Force Personnel Center to determine
appropriate recruitment sources. As a vacancy for competitive fill actions is announced, candidates
are screened by Air Force Personnel Center and one or more lists of candidates are referred to the
supervisor. Based on qualifying experience and/or education, civilians can enter civil service at different pay
grade levels. The competitive staffing process used by the USAF and other federal agencies
determines the relative qualifications of the candidates and refers the best qualified for selection. The U.S. OPM provides agencies with qualification standards written broadly for governmentwide application. 11.22. Civilian Resource Management
Civilian pay funds are needed for civilian overtime, awards, bonuses, student loan repayment
program, seasonal and longer-term overhires, voluntary separation incentive payments to
minimize involuntary reduction-in-force separations, and severance pay for affected employees as
<!-- Page 221 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
221
the result of reduction in force. Accurate requirement projections and development of employment
plans are critical to support the workload demand within budget, while executing work years, end
strength, and civilian pay resource. Civilian resource management is dependent on a team of leaders, to include commanders, senior
leaders, human resource officers, financial managers, and manpower officers who determine
effective use of employees, funds, and manpower authorizations to meet mission requirements. A
corporate board structure is used for meeting at least quarterly to manage annual appropriations, revolving funds, or reimbursements used for civilian employment costs. 11.23. Training and Development
USAF policy provides for necessary training to improve skills needed in employee performance. Supervisors are responsible for determining training requirements and working with the civilian
personnel sections or education and training functions to identify appropriate training sources. A
training-needs survey is conducted annually to provide supervisors an opportunity to project
training requirements for the upcoming fiscal year, but supervisors may request an out-of-cycle
training need at any time during the year. Supervisors should encourage civilian employees to
independently pursue training and education that will prepare them for promotion or develop them
for career transitions. The servicing employee development specialist is available to assist in
training needs analysis and identification of methods and training sources. For additional
information, refer to DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program and DAFI 36-2687, Civilian
Development. Sources of Training. The three primary sources of training are agency (USAF), interagency, and
nongovernment. Training that is conducted away from the work site is requested, approved, and
documented using Standard Form 182, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training. Agency Training. Agency training is conducted by the USAF and may include on-the-job
training, in-house training, and USAF formal schools. On-the-job training and in-house training
are often the most effective because the supervisor tailors the training to meet the specific job
requirements. In-house training is effective when a large number of employees need instruction
on common aspects of occupational skill requirements. More formalized agency classroom
training is available through USAF formal schools listed in the Education and Training Course
Announcements ETCA) website (https://www.aetc.af.mil/News/Force-Development/LearningProfessionals-and-FD-Credentials/Force-Development-Registrar/Education-and-TrainingCourse-Announcements/). Interagency Training. Interagency training includes all training sponsored by other U.S. Government agencies and may be needed if agency sources are not adequate to meet identified
training needs. The OPM, the Departments of Army and Navy, and the Departments of Labor and
Agriculture are just a few sources from which to obtain interagency training. Nongovernmental Training. Nongovernmental sources incorporate a wide range of seminars, conferences, courses, and workshops, as well as curricula offered by private educational
institutions. Federal regulations require agencies to consider and select government training
sources before turning to nongovernmental alternatives. However, nongovernmental sources may
be considered when agency or interagency courses cannot satisfy a training need or when
nongovernmental training is more advantageous. 11.24. Performance Planning, Appraisals, and Awards for Employees
Civilian employees are advised of duties and responsibilities of their jobs in their core personnel
document, and of their supervisor’s performance expectations in performance plans that are
<!-- Page 222 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
222
developed annually at the start of a performance rating cycle. Performance standards prescribe
how an employee’s accomplishment of a particular element or duty will be measured. Supervisors
set performance elements (duties and tasks) for civilian employees and determine the
major/important requirements of the job based on the employee’s direct contribution to
organization or work unit objectives. Employees receive annual appraisals on how well they perform their duties. The performance
appraisal is the basis for personnel actions to identify and correct work performance problems, recognize, and reward quality performance, improve productivity, and grant periodic pay increases. Supervisors review employee performance of each element and rate the performance against each
element’s standards, then render an overall summary rating. Employees who fail one or more
performance elements are administered an unacceptable appraisal and are given an opportunity to
improve. Supervisors may reward employees to recognize high performance. Performance awards (for
example, performance cash, time-off, and quality step increases) can be used as tools to motivate
civilian employees to perform above an acceptable level as well as compensate them for
performing beyond expectations. Effective management of the performance awards program can
help improve productivity and morale in the organization. 11.25. Standards of Conduct
DAFI 36-147, Civilian Conduct and Responsibility, and Joint Ethics Regulation, cover activities
that are mandatory for civilian employees and activities that are prohibited. All employees are
expected to maintain high standards of honesty, responsibility, and accountability - and to adhere
to the USAF core values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. Required activities include furnishing testimony in official investigations and hearings consistent
with protections against self-incrimination; paying lawful debts and taxes; being present for work
unless authorized to be absent; complying with health, safety, and all other proper instructions
regarding work; presenting a positive public image; complying with reasonable dress and
grooming standards; and maintaining professional relationships with fellow workers, subordinates, and supervisors. Prohibited actions include discrimination and sexual harassment; drug and alcohol abuse; misuse
of government purchase cards; misuse of government computers, vehicles, and other equipment; taking bribes; conducting personal business at work; and criminal behavior off-duty that reflect
adversely on USAF employment. The USAF does not attempt to list all possible forms of improper
conduct but emphasizes to employees that misconduct will not be tolerated. Civilian Pay: Note: Some civilian employees are paid through alternative personnel systems like
the Acquisition Demonstration Project or Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System. Servicing civilian personnel sections should be consulted for additional information concerning
how civilian pay is administered under an alternative personnel system. 11.26. Civilian Pay
General Schedule employee pay is expressed as an annual salary. The General Schedule grades
have 10 steps in each grade. Within grade or step, increases start at one-year intervals, but slow to
two- and three-year intervals in the higher steps. All General Schedule pay rates in the United States
include locality pay. Pay rates overseas do not include locality pay and are approximately 10
percent lower than United States rates. General Schedule pay scales normally increase in January
through the legislative process. <!-- Page 223 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
223
The Federal Wage system consists of wage grade, wage leader, and wage supervisor. Federal Wage
system grades have five steps, in which grade increases start at six-month intervals and slow to
eighteen-month and two-year intervals. The Federal Wage system pay is expressed as hourly wage
rates. Federal Wage system rates vary more between local areas than General Schedule. Federal
Wage system rates may also be increased annually, but on an area-by-area basis throughout the
year. For additional information on civilian pay, refer to AFI 36-128, Pay Setting and Allowances. 11.27. Work Hours
Civilian work schedules are defined in such terms as administrative workweek, basic workweek, regular tour of duty, uncommon tour of duty, and part-time tour of duty. Most civilians work a
regular tour of duty, which is normally five eight-hour days, Monday through Friday. Uncommon
tours of duty (a 40-hour basic workweek that includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer than five
days, but not more than six days of a seven-day administrative workweek) are authorized when
necessary for mission accomplishment. Special circumstances permit part-time, intermittent, or
special tours of duty. Installation and tenant commanders establish, by written order, daily work
hours to include designated rest and lunch periods. Two types of alternate work schedules can be
implemented by organization commanders. Flexible work schedules allow employees to start and
end work at different times. Compressed work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay period in fewer
than 10 workdays. The most common schedule has four nine-hour days each week, an eight-hour
day in one week, and a regular day off in the other week. For additional information on work hours, refer to DoDI1400.25V610_DAFI36-152, Hours of Work and Holiday Observances. 11.28. Absence and Leave
Civilian employees earn 13 days of sick leave each year, and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual leave, depending on their length of service. There is no cap on the accumulation of sick leave. Annual
leave accumulation is capped at 30 days for most civilian employees. Employees working overseas
can accumulate 45 days of annual leave. Annual leave is used for vacations and/or personal reasons, and should be approved in advance of
being taken, unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and taken in 15-minute
increments. Sick leave for medical appointments or care for a family member should be scheduled
and approved in advance, except in cases of emergency. Illness or injury that keeps an employee
away from work should be reported to a supervisor during the first two hours of the duty day. Absence for jury duty, dismissals for extreme weather conditions, or absences excused by the
installation commander are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have earned
compensatory time for overtime or time-off awards should schedule absences to use that time like
they schedule annual leave. For additional information on absence and leave, refer to
DoDI1400.25V630_AFI36-815, Leave. 11.29. Unions and Labor Management
Approximately 53 percent of USAF civilian employees are covered by labor agreements between
unions and installations or major commands. As such, they are members of the bargaining unit, even if they are not dues-paying union members. Unions have legal status under federal law. A
labor relations officer or specialist in the civilian personnel section is the usual liaison between
supervisors and other management officials and union officials. The labor relations officer speaks
for management in routine communications with the union and with parties outside the USAF who
have roles in labor contract negotiations and dispute resolution. Other union officials, such as
elected officers and appointed officials, may act and make commitments for unions. For additional
information on unions and labor management, refer to DAFI 36-701, Labor-Management

Relations. 11.30. Dispute Resolution
Civilian employees have a variety of avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management contracts
must include a negotiated grievance procedure to be used by members of the bargaining unit. Most
start with an option to seek resolution using outside neutral facilitators or mediators (alternative
dispute resolution). Supervisors, managers, and employees who are not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, or who are not members of the bargaining unit, follow different grievance
procedures. Administrative grievances are decided by USAF officials, usually the installation
commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used. For additional information on
dispute resolution and grievances, refer to DoDI 1400.25, DoD Civilian Personnel Management
