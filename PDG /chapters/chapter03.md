### USAF (18 September 1947 – Present)
Continuing the chronological events leading to our USAF of today and tomorrow, we recognize
that Airmen have been breaking barriers for over 70 years. With victory in World War II, on 26
July 1947 President Harry S. Truman signed into law the National Security Act of 1947, which
created a separate and independent Department of the Air Force. After a century of significant
advancements in aviation and after 40 years of operating under the U.S. Army, on 18 September
## the USAF was officially established as an independent, equal branch of our military. Under
the leadership of the first Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Carl A. Spaatz, the Air Force
clarified roles and missions to meet the challenges of the growing Cold War. First Female in USAF, Esther McGowin Blake. In June 1948, the Public
Law 80-625, Women's Armed Services Integration Act, 12 June 1948, gave
women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve Forces of all branches
of the military. On 8 July 1948, Esther McGowin Blake became the first
woman in the USAF, enlisting the first minute of the first hour of the first
day that USAF duty was authorized. Although it was not her first experience
with the military, her driving force for serving was to free a soldier from
clerical work to fight, with the hopes of ending the war sooner. 3.2.The Berlin Blockade and Operation Vittles
Ester McGowin
Blake
On 24 June 1948, the Soviet Union blockaded surface routes between Berlin and the Western
occupation zones in Germany, exploiting the arrangements under which the United States, Great
Britain, and France had occupied Germany. The Soviets blockaded railroad and road corridors to
the 2.5 million residents of West Berlin, located deep within Communist East Germany. Two days after the Soviet Union blockade, the Allies worried that an attack against the blockade
on the ground could precipitate World War III. Instead, an air bridge into Berlin was built, and for
## months the 2.5 million inhabitants of the Western sectors of Berlin were sustained by airpower. The Berlin Airlift, also known as Operation Vittles, delivered an abundance of supplies, food, medicine, and coal on C-47 and C-54 cargo aircraft. More than 2.3 million tons of supplies were
delivered on over 277,000 flights, which equated to one flight every three minutes. When the Soviets finally lifted the blockade, the airlift’s success represented one of the great
Western victories of the Cold War. The principles of rapid decision-making and adaptability that
are central to the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop (DAF 8-step Practical Problem
Solving Model/Method) were certainly demonstrated during the Berlin Airlift. The success of the
operation was largely due to the ability of the Allied forces to quickly observe the situation, orient
themselves to the changing conditions, decide on the best course of action, and act effectively to
sustain the city of Berlin during the Soviet blockade. This process was iterative and continuous, which aligns with the OODA loop’s emphasis on agility and responsiveness. The Berlin Airlift
was arguably airpower’s single-most decisive contribution to the Cold War, unquestionably
achieving a profound strategic effect through the nonviolent use of airpower and defusing a
potentially disastrous confrontation. <!-- Page 49 -->

### The Korean War
The Peninsula Divided. In the early 1900s, China had
political interests in the Korean Peninsula, but through
the early- and mid-1900s, Korea was ruled by Japan. After World War II ended, the Korean Peninsula was
essentially divided into two fronts: the Soviet Union
liberated North Korea (the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea) and the United States aligned with
South Korea (the Republic of Korea). Separated at the
38th parallel, the North and South Korean governments
did not settle on an agreement to the terms of the
separation. The feuding between the two sides escalated
to a new level when Communist North Korea launched
a massive invasion on South Korea on 25 June 1950. Geographically, Korea was of interest to the United
States because of its proximity to Japan. Also, the rise
of Communist parties was of concern that made
intervention in the Korean War a challenging, yet
compelling decision. President Truman emphasized the
importance of the global containment of communism
and advocated for sending military support in the
Korean Peninsula. Figure 3.1. The Korean Peninsula
Battle of Osan. The United Nations, led heavily by the United States, quickly engaged in support
of the South while China and the Soviet Union aligned with the North. Battles ensued in Korea
from June through September in 1950, with severe gains and losses on both sides. The Battle of
Osan was primarily fought by the U.S. Army in July 1950. Significant losses were experienced
by the 24th Infantry Division and they were forced to retreat. The ruthless actions of the North
Korean forces heightened our determination, but with less than adequate weaponry and armor, defense of the South only secured 10 percent of the Korean Peninsula. Battle of Pusan Perimeter. In August and September 1950, to prevent the North from furthering
their advance, six weeks of relentless air, land, and sea attacks ran their forces underground, halting
the Communist invaders in their tracks. Meanwhile, efforts were successful in reinforcing South
Korea’s forces and supplies to defend the perimeter. By the battle’s end, North Korean forces were
pushed back at all points along the perimeter. Battle of Inchon. In September 1950, President Truman authorized the pursuit of North Korea’s
Army north of the 38th parallel. During the Battle of Inchon, although both air superiority and
close air support missions were successful, a lengthy attempt to disrupt Communist supply lines
by air attack failed. A new strategy of systematic campaigning was applied to inflict prolonged
economic cost to North Korea and the Chinese forces as long as war persisted. Drawing the Line. The initial phase of the Korean War illustrated the dangers of being unprepared
as Airmen struggled to relearn close air support and interdiction skills. As the Korean War ensued, air battles in the skies above Korea challenged our capabilities, but not our resolve. The United
Nation’s efforts repelled two communist invasions of South Korea, and American airpower
secured the skies against enemy air attack. Older USAF aircraft were replaced with the much
needed, more dominating airpower of F-86 Sabre jet-engine fighters that battled over “MiG Alley”
where superior training and experience prevailed. The Air Rescue Service medically evacuated
<!-- Page 50 -->

more than 9,600 wounded soldiers and rescued nearly 1,000 personnel shot down over enemy
territory during the Korean War. The fighting finally ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice
was signed. The agreement created the Korean demilitarized zone to separate North and South
Korea by a strip of land approximately four kilometers (2.48 miles) wide, as shown in Figure 3.1. The demilitarized zone still exists today. With no peace treaty signed, the two Koreas are
technically still at war. 3.4. Relief Operations in Mid-1900’s
Hungarian Relief and Operations Safe Haven I & II. Following the Hungarian Revolution of
1956, the humanitarian missions Operation Safe Haven I (1956) and II (1957) were initiated for
Hungarian refugees. The USAF airlifted over 10,000 refugees to asylum who fled from Hungary
after Soviet forces crushed the anti-communist uprising. Chilean Natural Disasters and Operation Amigos Airlift. In May 1960, earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, avalanches, and tidal waves ripped through southern Chile, leaving nearly 8,000 people
dead or missing, 5,500 injured, and more than 240,000 homeless. The Department of Defense and
State Department agreed to provide humanitarian assistance. During the month-long Amigos
Airlift, the USAF airlifted over 1,000 tons of material to the stricken area. 3.5. Cuban Missile Crisis
In 1959, Fidel Castro, a communist revolutionary, overthrew the dictator of Cuba, initially
promising free elections, but instead, instituted a dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans
fled to the United States. In late 1960, President Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence
Agency to plan an invasion using Cuban exiles as troops to overthrow Castro and install a proU.S. Government. In mid-April 1961, during John F. Kennedy’s presidency, the invasion was
ordered to proceed. The Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs and suffered a crushing defeat. The
Soviet Union almost immediately increased economic and military aid to Cuba. In August 1962, photographs from a U-2 aircraft from Strategic Air Command confirmed the
construction of intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missile complexes on Cuba. Our military
forces began preparations for an invasion, conducted low-level reconnaissance flights, deployed
aircraft to numerous bases in Florida, dispersed nuclear-capable B-47 aircraft across the United
States, and kept B-52 heavy bombers in the air ready to strike. Tensions escalated while President
Kennedy, his national security advisors, and senior military officials discussed the most effective
course of action against the Soviet Union. Many on the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored an invasion, but President Kennedy chose to impose a naval blockade of the island to prevent more materiel
from reaching Cuba. Still technically an act of war, the blockade had the advantage of not
escalating tensions of the Cold War. While military preparations continued, the United States agreed not to invade Cuba in exchange
for removal of Soviet missiles from the island. Secretly, we also agreed to remove American
missiles from Turkey. The Soviets turned their Cuban-bound ships around, packed up the missiles
in Cuba, and dismantled the launch pads. As the work progressed, the USAF gradually deployed
aircraft back to home bases and lowered the alert status. The Cuban missile crisis brought the
United States and the Soviet Union dangerously close to nuclear war. Our strategic and tactical
power, coupled with the will and ability to use it, provided the synergy to deter nuclear war and
convince Soviet leaders to remove the nuclear weapons from Cuba. Note: In the early 1960s, the
strategic doctrine of mutually assured destruction came to the forefront of national strategy. The
doctrine was based on the theory that superpower strategic nuclear forces could be sized and
protected to survive a nuclear attack and retaliate with sufficient force to destroy the other side. <!-- Page 51 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Such retaliatory destruction was considered to be deterrent under the premise that no rational leader
would start a nuclear war knowing the result would be nuclear destruction. In May 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty. The Treaty entered into force in October 1972 and originally permitted both parties to
deploy two fixed, ground-based anti-ballistic missile sites. One site could protect the national
capital, while the second could be located at an ICBM field. Subsequently, a July 1975 protocol
halved the numbered of permitted ABM sites. The United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty
in June 2002. 3.6. Vietnam Conflict
The Vietnam Conflict was fought primarily between the North Vietnamese and the South
Vietnamese over which side would govern Vietnam. North Vietnam, represented by the Viet Minh
under Ho Chi Minh’s direction, gained support from China and Russia. South Vietnam, supported
by the French as the official government of the country, was aided by the United States and Great
Britain. In the 1950s, our involvement in Vietnam began as a cold war operation. The post-World
War II policy of containment of communism prompted President Harry S. Truman to increase the
military footprint, thus engaging in the conflict, but not declaring war. As offensive air operations increased, USAF presence in Southeast Asia increased even more. Airmen performed various duties, including support, combat, and rescue missions. Base Engineer
Emergency Force Teams, often referred to as Prime BEEF, built revetments, barracks, and other
facilities. Rapid Engineering Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineer Teams, often referred to as REDHORSE, provided more long-range civil engineer services. In addition, enlisted personnel served on gunships during the war as aerial gunners and loadmasters. Operation Farmgate. In 1961, in response to Communist efforts in Laos and South Vietnam, President Kennedy ordered Operation Farmgate. The operation involved the covert deployment of
the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (Jungle Jim) to provide training to the South
Vietnamese Air Force. Flying T-28 Trojans, A-26 Invaders, and A-1E Skyraiders, American pilots
launched attack missions under the umbrella of combat training. Operation Pierce Arrow. In 1964, the North Vietnamese fired on the USS Maddox and USS
Turner Joy while patrolling in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. Following this incident, the Gulf
of Tonkin Resolution was passed, authorizing President Lyndon B. Johnson to use conventional
force in Southeast Asia without requiring a formal declaration of war by Congress. Our advisory
role rapidly evolved into one of combat operations. The first bombing raids against North Vietnam
occurred that same year when President Johnson lifted the shroud of secrecy over the operations
being conducted. As a show of force, the United States orchestrated air attacks against the North
Vietnamese and Communist forces in Cambodia. Operation Flaming Dart I & II. In 1965, the North Vietnamese Viet Cong attacked a small U.S. advisory detachment in II Corps, four-and one-half miles north of Pleiku. Moreover, they also
struck Camp Holloway. The joint assaults killed eight Americans and wounded 104. The United
States responded with Operation Flaming Dart I, a series of 49 air strikes against various military
targets in North Vietnam. When the Viet Cong retaliated against the strikes by attacking a hotel
where Americans were being housed, Operation Flaming Dart II was initiated with additional air
attacks and reinforced with aircraft launches from three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. Operation Arc Light. From 1965 to 1973, the USAF provided close air support, interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, tanker support, and search-and-rescue capabilities to operations in
Vietnam. Resources used during Operation Arc Light ranged from one-man Cessna O-1s used by
<!-- Page 52 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
52
forward air controllers for marking enemy targets for strikers, to mammoth B-52Ds modified to
drop as many as 27 750-pound bombs and 84 500-pound bombs. During this time, vintage World
War II aircraft like AC-47 gunships joined the advanced terrain-following radar F-111 state-ofthe-art platforms. Complementing operations over North Vietnam, this aspect of the air war over
South Vietnam demonstrated the full-spectrum of airpower. Operation Rolling Thunder. In 1965, faced with a deteriorating political and military situation
in South Vietnam, President Johnson ordered Operation Rolling Thunder as a sign of American
support to South Vietnam and a signal of our resolve. Operation Rolling Thunder was implemented
as a measured and limited approach against selected military targets in North Vietnam south of the
19th parallel. The objective was to destroy the will of the North Vietnamese to fight, destroy
industrial bases and air defenses, and stop the flow of men and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh
Trail, while forcing North Vietnam into peace negotiations. In response, North Vietnamese air
defenses multiplied, as well as their Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air missile inventory. Hanoi
established an advanced radar-controlled air defense system that combined surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and Soviet-produced MiG-17 and MiG-21 interceptors. Tet Offensive. In 1968, approximately 70,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces launched
a coordinated series of fierce attacks on more than 100 cities in South Vietnam. The leader of the
Communist People’s Army of Vietnam planned the offensive in an attempt to provoke rebellion
among the South Vietnamese population and encourage the United States to scale back support of
the Saigon regime. United States and South Vietnamese forces managed to hold off the Communist
attacks during what is referred to as the Tet Offensive, named for the Lunar New Year (Tet). However, heavy casualties were suffered on both sides. News coverage shocked and dismayed the
American public and further eroded support. North Vietnam achieved a strategic victory with the
Tet Offensive, as the attacks marked a turning point in Vietnam and the beginning of the
methodical American withdrawal from the region. By the fall of 1968, USAF tactical aircraft and Navy attack aircraft had flown over 300,000 sorties
over North Vietnam. The enemy downed 526 aircraft, and personnel losses were equally heavy. Of the 745 USAF crew members shot down over North Vietnam, 145 were rescued, 255 were
confirmed killed, 222 were captured, and 123 were classified as missing in action. USAF leaders
found these results intolerable for an air campaign with virtually complete air superiority. Operation Niagara. In 1968, the siege of Khe Sanh displayed the potential of USAF close air
support. When more than 20,000 North Vietnamese troops, protected by hilly, covered terrain, surrounded 6,000 U.S. Marines, the USAF applied massive firepower. A flight of three B-52s hit
the enemy every 90 minutes for most of the 77-day siege. To prevent the enemy from overrunning
the base, aircraft dropped 100,000 tons of bombs, two-thirds of those from B-52s. 3.7. Vietnamization
In 1968, shortly after taking office, President Richard M. Nixon announced that a primary goal of
his administration would be to end the United States combat role in Southeast Asia by helping
empower the South Vietnamese with equipment and training. He charged the Secretary of Defense
with making Vietnamization of the war a top priority. In 1969, Nixon initiated a phased withdrawal
from the frustrating conflict in Vietnam. Dropping from nearly 536,000 troops in 1968, American
personnel numbered fewer than 100,000 by 1972. As the Vietnamese took over air operations, their Air Force grew to become the fourth largest in the world. Operation Linebacker. In 1972, taking advantage of reduced American ground presence, Communist forces of the National Liberation Front crossed the demilitarized zone in Vietnam. President Nixon ordered to have the harbors mined, and peace talks broke down. Nixon resolved
<!-- Page 53 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
53
to achieve peace with honor, which made reinforcing ground troops politically impossible, so
Nixon employed Operation Linebacker to blunt the Communist attack. Operation Linebacker demonstrated to both the North and South Vietnamese that even without
significant U.S. Army ground forces, the United States could still influence the war. During
Operation Linebacker military leaders were able to apply appropriate strategy and tactics with
significantly reduced restrictions and advantages gained due to improvements in technology. Particularly, the acquisition of precision-guided munitions and laser-guided smart bombs
dramatically increased strike accuracy. On 13 May 1972, 14 F-4 Phantoms hit the Thanh Hóa
Bridge with 24 smart bombs, destroying a target that had eluded attack for years. From April to
October 1972, our USAF and Navy aircraft dropped over 155,000 tons of bombs on North
Vietnamese troops. When North Vietnamese negotiators accepted specific peace conditions, President Nixon terminated the air campaign. Operation Linebacker II. In December 1972, North Vietnamese resistance to submit to the terms
of the final peace agreement prompted President Nixon to initiate Operation Linebacker II, an
intense 11-day air campaign to pressure enemy compliance. Within two weeks, 729 B-52s dropped
15,000 tons of bombs. Fighter-bombers added another 5,000 tons on industrial targets in North
Vietnam. Operation Linebacker II succeeded in breaking the deadlock, and negotiations with
North Vietnamese resumed. A comprehensive ceasefire was signed on 28 January 1973. On 29
March 1974, the last of our troops left the country. Despite the ceasefire, fighting between the North and the South continued until April 22 when the
President of South Vietnam resigned. During the Vietnam era, airpower demonstrated its
versatility and wide-ranging impact, as well as its limitations. Despite an impressive military
showing, the United States did not win decisively in Vietnam. Although the USAF flew more than
five million sorties and dropped six million tons of bombs, the country of Vietnam was officially
unified under a Communist regime on 2 July 1976. Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, William H. Pitsenbarger. William H. Pitsenbarger joined the USAF on New Year’s Eve in 1962. After pararescue training in 1965, he reported to Detachment 6, 38th Air
Rescue and Recovery Squadron, Bien Hoa Air Base, near Saigon, Republic of South Vietnam. His leadership referred to him as “one of a
special breed, alert and always ready to go on any mission.” On 11 April
1966, Airman Pitsenbarger was aboard a rescue helicopter responding to a
call to evacuate casualties from an ongoing firefight. When he arrived at
the site, he descended from the helicopter to coordinate rescue efforts, care
for the wounded, prepare casualties for evacuation, and ensure the
recovery operation was smooth and orderly. William
Pitsenbarger
Several times he refused to evacuate and chose to remain with the Army troops on the ground. As
the battle raged, Pitsenbarger repeatedly risked exposure to enemy fire while pulling the wounded
to safety, caring for them, and returning fire when possible. During the fight, he was wounded
three times. When others ran low on ammunition, he gathered ammo clips from the dead and
distributed them to the living. Having administered aid, he picked up a rifle and joined the soldiers
to help hold off the Viet Cong. Pitsenbarger was killed by Viet Cong snipers later that night. When his body was recovered the next day, one hand still held a rifle and the other clutched a
medical kit. Nine men escaped the battle alive, thanks to Pitsenbarger’s courage and devotion to
duty. Pitsenbarger flew almost 300 rescue missions in Vietnam, routinely risking his life to save
others. He was posthumously promoted as Staff Sergeant Pitsenbarger, and for his bravery and
sacrifice, he was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross. Also, on 8 December 2000, <!-- Page 54 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
54
Pitsenbarger’s parents accepted the posthumous upgrade to the Medal of Honor from the
Secretary of the Air Force. Pitsenbarger was the first enlisted Airmen to receive both medals
posthumously. Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, Duane Hackney. Duane
Hackney flew more than 200 combat missions in three and a half years of
Vietnam duty. On 6 February 1967, Hackney descended from a HH-3E in
search of a downed pilot. As he and the downed pilot were being extracted, their helicopter took a direct hit from a 37-mm anti-aircraft gun and burst
into flames. Wounded by shell fragments and suffering third-degree burns, Hackney put his own parachute on the rescued pilot and got him out of the
doomed chopper. Groping through dense smoke, he found an oil-soaked
chute and slipped it on. Before he could buckle it, a second shell hit the
helicopter, blowing him out the door, but he survived. In 1973, Hackney left
the USAF and returned four years later as a pararescue instructor. He retired
as Chief Master Sergeant Hackney, earned the Air Force Cross, four Distinguished Flying
Crosses, the Silver Star, the Airman's Medal, the Purple Heart, 18 Air Medals, many for single
acts of valor, and several foreign decorations. He received more than 70 awards and decorations in
all, and received the Cheney Award for his actions in 1967, an honor presented for valor or selfsacrifice. At one point (and often even now), he is referred to as the “most decorated enlisted
Airman.”
Duane Hackney
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, Richard L. Etchberger. As
one of the USAF’s most highly trained radar technicians, Richard Loy
“Dick” Etchberger volunteered for a highly classified mission at Lima Site
## in Laos. On 11 March 1968, Etchberger was the crew chief of a radar
team when North Vietnamese forces overran his site. Under heavy fire, he
defended his comrades, called in air strikes, and directed an air
evacuation. When a rescue helicopter arrived, he put himself in the line of
fire to load three Airmen into rescue slings. Etchberger was rescued after
putting the other Airmen on the helicopter. While inside the helicopter and
as they were departing the area, a round went through the belly of the helicopter, striking Etchberger
and he bled out before they returned to the forward operating base. For extraordinary heroism and
superb leadership, Etchberger was posthumously awarded
the Air Force Cross. On 21
September 2010, Etchberger’s three sons accepted the posthumous upgrade to the Medal of
Honor from President Barack H. Obama. Chief Master Sergeant Etchberger is the first E-9 in the
Department of Defense to receive the nation’s highest award. Richard Etchberger
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, John L. Levitow. On 24
February 1969, flying combat missions as a loadmaster over Vietnam, John L. Levitow was handling Mark 24 magnesium flares when his pilot
threw the aircraft and its eight-man crew into a turn to engage the Viet
Cong. The AC-47 Skytrain, was jarred by a tremendous explosion and
bathed in a blinding flash of light when an 82-millimeter mortar shell
landed on the right wing. Despite 40 shrapnel wounds in his legs, side, and
back, Levitow rescued a fellow crewmember who was perilously close to
the open cargo door. When he saw a burning 27-pound magnesium flare
rolling amid ammunition cans that contained 19,000 live rounds, through a
haze of pain and shock, and fighting a 30-degree bank, Levitow crawled to the flare, hugged it to
his body, and dragged himself to the rear of the aircraft. At the instant he hurled it through the
open cargo door, the flare separated and ignited in the air. John L. Levitow
<!-- Page 55 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

The aircraft returned to base with more than 3,500 holes in the wings and fuselage, one more than
three feet long. Levitow spent two and a half months recovering in the hospital before returning
to Vietnam for another tour. He received the Medal of Honor from President Nixon during a 14
May 1970 Armed Forces Day ceremony at the White House. He was honorably discharged four
years later as Sergeant Levitow. On 22 January 1998, Air Mobility Command named one of its C17 Globemaster III aircraft, The Spirit of John Levitow. Levitow was buried with military
honors 17 November 2000 at Arlington National Cemetery. He is the lowest ranking Airman
ever to receive the Medal of Honor for exceptional heroism during wartime. The John L. Levitow
Award is the top award presented during enlisted professional military education. Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, Wayne Fisk. Wayne Fisk
was directly involved in the famed Son Tay Prisoner of War Camp raid
and the rescue of the crew of the USS Mayaquez. When the USS
Mayaquez was hijacked by Cambodian Communist forces in May 1975, Fisk was a member of the assault force that successfully recovered the
ship, the crew, and the entrapped U.S. Marines. Concluding the mission, he was recognized as the last American serviceman to engage Communist
forces in ground combat in Southeast Asia. For his actions, Fisk was
presented with his second Silver Star. In 1979, he was the first USAF
enlisted recipient of the U.S. Jaycees 10 Outstanding Young Men of America. In 1986, Chief
Master Sergeant Fisk became the first director of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall on Maxwell
Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, Alabama. Wayne Fisk
### The Post-Vietnam Era
The North Vietnamese captured Saigon in April 1975. The number of operations that ensued
during the 1960s and 1970s, and the millions of casualties and devastation of the citizens of the
countries involved, left a sinking void in the lost attempts to contain communism. After the war
ended, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees required temporary relocation until
permanent locations could be established. Many of these refugees were resettled in the United
States. Red Flag. The Vietnam-era USAF included many members who entered the ranks during World
War II. President Nixon ended the draft in 1973 in favor of an all-volunteer American military. The USAF attracted recruits and maintained enough Vietnam career veterans to allow significant
changes, beginning with realistic, more dangerous, combat training. By 1975, training was being
conducted during Red Flag at the USAF Weapons and Tactics Center, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Aircrews flew individual sorties and formations in realistic situations to gain application
experience before actual combat. Red Flag is credited for revolutionizing USAF training. Rebuilding. Post-Vietnam military service rebuilding included the application of technological
improvements for air campaigns. Plans for the F-15 Eagle, followed soon after by the F-16
Fighting Falcon, filled the need for highly maneuverable dogfighting aircraft armed with missiles
and cannons. For conducting deep air attacks, isolating the enemy on the battlefield, conducting
battlefield air interdiction, disrupting the movement of secondary forces to the front, and providing
close air support to Army ground forces, the USAF procured the A-10 Thunderbolt. Additionally, the United States developed the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter to negate the dangers posed by
radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. When the F-117 was operationalized
in 1980, stealth technology featured special paints, materials, and designs to reduce or eliminate
aircraft radar, thermal, and electronic signatures. Laser-guided bombs, electro-optically-guided
missiles, and other precision technologies changed the focus of USAF doctrine from strategic
bombing to pinpoint bombing through economy of force. <!-- Page 56 -->

### Iran Hostage Crisis and Operation Eagle Claw
In April 1980, Operation Eagle Claw kicked off as an attempt to rescue 52 American hostages
from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran. The Americans were held hostage for 444 days, from 4
November 1979 to 20 January 1981 when a group of Iranian students who supported the Iranian
Revolution took over the U.S. Embassy. In the United States, the hostage crisis united Americans
to recognize the situation as a threat against diplomacy and ignited a sense of patriotism across our
country. However, Operation Eagle Claw was ultimately aborted at the request of field
commanders directly involved in the mission. They experienced too many obstacles and
mechanical problems with the helicopter fleet for the rescue to be conducted successfully. The
hostages were eventually released as a result of political negotiations and were returned home to
the United States. The Iran Hostage Crisis is recognized as the longest hostage crisis in recorded
history. 3.10. Grenada Invasion and Operation Urgent Fury
In October 1983, a military coup on the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada arrested and then
assassinated Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, imposed a 24-hour shoot-on-sight curfew, and closed
the airport. President Ronald W. Reagan, who did not want a repetition of the Iranian Hostage
Crisis, considered military intervention to rescue the 600 American citizens who were attending
medical school on the island. During Operation Urgent Fury, the bulk of USAF support consisted
of airlift and special operations units. AC-130 gunships proved their worth repeatedly, showing
more versatility and accuracy than naval bombardment and land artillery. Several USAF enlisted
personnel were cited for special achievement and received praise for their efforts. The invasion to rescue the students and restore order to Grenada was strongly criticized by several
countries and was described as a flagrant violation of international law by the United Nations
General Assembly. However, there was strong public support for the mission in the United States
and the date of the invasion is celebrated in Grenada annually. The operation resulted in the
appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984, and has
remained a democratic nation since. 3.11. Overthrow of Libya and Operation Odyssey Dawn
In 1969, a group of junior military officers led by Muammar al-Qaddafi (often spelled Gaddafi)
overthrew the pro-Western Libyan Arab monarchy. Left virtually unchecked, by the mid-1980s
Libya had taken several steps toward demonstrating support and sponsorship of worldwide
terrorism. Qadhafi was involved in subversion; global assassinations of anti-Qadhafi Libyan exiles
and other adversaries; sponsorship of terrorist training camps within Libya; as well as supply of
funds, weapons, logistics, and safe haven establishments for numerous terrorist groups. With terrorism on the rise at alarming rates, National Security Decision Directive 138 was signed
on 3 April 1984 by President Reagan to establish a national policy of preemptive and retaliatory
strikes against terrorists. Unfortunately, despite strong evidence that connected Libya to a number
of terrorist incidents, the United States did not have sufficient proof to order retaliatory strikes. In
response, President Reagan chose to impose sanctions against Libya and publicly denounce
Qadhafi, particularly for sponsoring attacks on the airports in Rome and Vienna, Italy. Two years
after imposing sanctions, Libya was found responsible for the bombing of a popular discotheque, La Belle, in West Berlin. This time President Reagan had the evidence he sought, and he authorized
air strikes against Libya. Within one week, air strikes were carried out by the USAF, Navy, and
Marine Corps. Although the raid was supported in the United States, it was almost universally
“regretted” by our European Allies for fear that it would spawn more violence. <!-- Page 57 -->

In 2011, the first Libyan Civil War, referred to as the Libyan Revolution, broke out between
Qadhafi loyalists and those seeking to remove him from power. Under the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1973, in March the United States engaged in Operation Odyssey Dawn, implementing a no-fly zone. By the end of March, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), under Operation Unified Protector, assumed control of the no-fly zone, conducted air
strikes, and imposed additional actions, such as the arms embargo. Qadhafi was captured and killed
by the opposing forces of the National Transitional Council on 20 October 2011. Due to continued
conflict over rival governments, territory, and oil rights, the second Libyan Civil War began in
## A United Nations assisted cease-fire was agreed to in December 2015 that led to a new
‘unity government’ but with little confidence among its people. The country currently remains
under the unity government. 3.12. Panama Canal and Operation Just Cause
In 1904, the Republic of Panama granted the United States occupation and control of an area
referred to as the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is a 40-mile-long canal that connects the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal was controlled by the United States until joint ownership
was established with Panama in 1979 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. In 1983, Central
Intelligence Agency informant and military dictator, General Manuel Noriega, became the de facto
Panamanian leader. Noriega continued furnishing information on Latin American drug trafficking
and money laundering, while at the same time engaging in such activities. Noriega’s actions grew increasingly destructive and his relationship with the United States
deteriorated. President George H.W. Bush decided to take action and invade Panama to safeguard
the lives of 35,000 American citizens in Panama. Emphasis was also placed on defending
democracy and human rights in Panama, combating drug trafficking, and protecting the integrity
of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. In 1989, Operation Just Cause tested air operations in Panama as the largest and most complex air
operation since Vietnam, involving four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and more than 250
aircraft. The USAF primarily airlifted troops and supplies, but also debuted the F-117 Nighthawk. On the first night of the operation, 84 aircraft flying 500 feet above the ground dropped nearly
5,000 troops, the largest nighttime airborne operation since World War II. The organized resistance
was eliminated in just six days. Manuel Noriega surrendered on 3 January 1990 and was flown to
Miami, Florida to face a federal grand jury for drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The Panama Canal was fully turned over to Panama on 31 December 1999. <!-- Page 58 -->

### American-Soviet Relations
In a 23 March 1983 address, President Ronald W. Reagan proposed replacing the doctrine of
mutually assured destruction with one of assured survival, through implementation of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. The Strategic Defense Initiative would include a combination of defensive
systems, such as space-based lasers, particle beams, railguns, and fast ground-launched missiles
to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles in the earth’s outer atmosphere and ballistic path in
space. Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Beginning in March 1985, Soviet Communist Party
General, Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, initiated major changes in Soviet-American relations. The
United States and Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF
Treaty) in December 1987. The treaty entered into force in June 1988 and eliminated an entire
class of weapons, ground launched cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500-5500
kilometers. In February 2019 because of Russia’s non-compliance with the treaty, the United
States declared suspension of U.S. obligations under the INF Treaty, in addition formally
announcing its intention to withdraw from the treaty in six months. In March 2019, President
Putin signed Russia’s suspension of the INF Treaty into law. The United States withdrew from
the INF Treaty in August 2019. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties. American nuclear strategy changed significantly in response
to post-Cold War policies and initiatives. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), signed
by the United States and the Soviet Union in July 1991, entered into force in December 1994 and
expired in December 2009. Under START I, the United States agreed to reduce arms to 6,000 total
warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. The USAF, by presidential direction in September 1991, notified Strategic Air
Command to remove heavy bombers from alert status. Strategic Air Command was subsequently
inactivated in June 1992. U.S. Strategic Command replaced Strategic Air Command and assumed
control of all remaining USAF and Navy strategic nuclear forces. START II, signed in January 1993 by the United States and Russia, would reduce total deployed
warheads up to a range of 3,500 nautical miles, but the agreement never officially went into effect. In 1997, START III was initiated, but was never signed due to negotiations breaking down between
the two countries. The New START Treaty, officially named The Treaty between the United
States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, was signed in April 2010, and entered into force in
February 2011. The treaty was extended for one-time five-year period in February 2021 and will
expire in February 2026. 3.14. Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait
Operation Desert Shield. On 2 August 1990, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ordered 100,000
troops to invade oil-rich Kuwait, claiming Kuwait as Iraq’s 19th province. The invasion, with the
fourth largest Army in the world and an extensive program to develop nuclear weapons, put Iraq
on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia with vast petroleum reserves. If the Saudis were to fall to Iraq, the
dictator would then control 50 percent of the world’s oil. The United States sought and received a
United Nations sanction to act against Iraq and joined 35 other nations to launch Operation Desert
<!-- Page 59 -->

Shield. The defensive deployment was an impressive accomplishment. On 8 August 1990, 24 F15Cs landed in Saudi Arabia after departing 15 hours earlier from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. Within one week, C-141 and C-5 transports delivered the Army 82d Airborne Division
and elements of the Air Force 1st Tactical Fighter Wing to defend Saudi Arabia and the other
Persian Gulf states against further aggression. Less than one month after mobilization, 1,220 Allied aircraft were in theater and combat ready, aimed first at deterring Saddam Hussein from aggression against the Saudis, then preparing for a
counter invasion, if necessary. Operation Desert Shield eclipsed the Berlin Airlift as the greatest
air deployment in history. Between August 1990 and January 1991, Military Airlift Command
cargo planes conducted 20,500 strategic airlift missions, delivered 534,000 personnel, and carried
542,000 tons of cargo to the theater. Operation Desert Storm. President George H.W. Bush demanded the immediate withdrawal of
Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Believing that the American public lacked the stomach for war, for more
than six months Saddam Hussein alternated between defiance and vague promises of compliance. When Saddam missed the final deadline to withdraw his troops from Kuwait, the United States
lost patience with Saddam’s refusal to cooperate, and initiated Operation Desert Storm. At 0100, 17 January 1991, three USAF Special Operations MH-53J Pave Low helicopters led nine Army
Apaches on the first strike mission. Under the command of Lieutenant General Charles A. Horner, U.S. Central Command Air Forces, aircraft from 14 countries implemented the master attack plan. Within hours, the world watched live television coverage while Iraqi skies filled with anti-aircraft
artillery fire. In response to Iraq’s modified Soviet scud missiles launched against Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the
Persian Gulf States, the USAF commenced what became known as ‘the great scud hunt’ with a
fleet of A-10s, F-16s, and F-15Es with low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night
pods. The F-117As struck heavily defended targets with unprecedented precision and successfully
evaded the sophisticated Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses. A flight of seven B-52Gs flew nonstop from
Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana to strike Iraqi power stations and communications facilities. At 35 hours round-trip, the 14,000-mile raid was the longest combat mission up to that time, and
proof of America’s global reach. The fleet shattered Iraqi Army morale with massive bomb drops. After establishing air dominance and destroying the enemy’s command and control system, coalition forces turned their attention to entrenched enemy ground forces, who were evidently
willing to surrender to the first Allied troops they saw. When one Iraqi commander candidly
asserted that he surrendered because of B-52 strikes, his interrogator pointed out that his position
had never been attacked by the B-52. “That is true,” the Iraqi asserted, “but I saw one that had
been attacked.”
While coalition ground forces delivered General Schwarzkopf’s famous Hail Mary outflanking
maneuver that applied the final blow to the Iraqi military forces, airpower set the stage for victory. As stated in the Gulf War Air Power Survey, “It was not the number of Iraqi tanks or artillery
pieces destroyed, or the number of Iraqi soldiers killed that mattered. It was the effectiveness of
the air campaign in breaking apart the organizational structure and cohesion of enemy military
forces and in reaching the mind of the Iraqi soldier that counted.” On 28 February 1991, scarcely
## hours after the air war ended and the land invasion took center stage, Iraq surrendered to the
coalition. Despite over 2,700 sorties (22 percent of the strategic air phase), the enemy managed
to launch 88 scuds, including one that struck a U.S. Army Reserve unit at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers and wounding 98. Over the course of the air campaign, the coalition flew over
118,000 sorties, of which the USAF flew 60 percent. In the 43-day war, the USAF was, for the
first time in modern combat, the equal partner of land and sea power. <!-- Page 60 -->

Gulf War Space Assets. The Gulf War represented the first extensive, broad-based employment
of space support capabilities. Coalition forces employed more than 60 military satellites, as well
as commercial and civil sector systems during the conflict. The defense meteorological satellite
program provided dedicated meteorological support in theater, which helped facilitate safe, highly
effective combat power planning and application in a harsh environment characterized by
sandstorms and oil fires. Satellite-based systems delivered more than 90 percent of all
communications to and from the theater due to the sheer volume and the lack of ground-based
infrastructure. At the height of the conflict, 700,000 phone calls and 152,000 messages per day
flowed over satellite links. USAF space assets provided precision positioning and navigation to joint and coalition forces with
the combat debut of the global positioning system. Space forces also provided advanced Iraqi scud
launch warnings that gave coalition partners sufficient time to engage the incoming missiles. Space
force capabilities influenced Israel to remain neutral, thereby preserving the integrity of the
coalition as well. The Persian Gulf War was the first conflict to highlight the force enhancement
capabilities of space-based communications, intelligence, navigation, missile warning, weather
satellites, and precision guided munitions in modern warfare with the joint community. Iraqi Kurd Population and Operation Provide Comfort I. In 1991, following the Persian Gulf
War, Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, attacked the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq. Fearing a
repeat of the previous threat of brutal suppression, chemical weapons, and massacres by Iraqi
troops, more than a million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey and hundreds of thousands more
gathered on cold mountain slopes on the Iraqi-Turkish border. Lacking food, clean water, clothing, blankets, medical supplies, and shelter, the refugees suffered enormous mortality rates. In response
to the unfolding tragedy, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 688 and
authorized a humanitarian relief effort. The United States organized and combined a task force for
Operation Provide Comfort that delivered 7,000 tons of supplies and airlifted thousands of
displaced Kurds to safety. Operation Provide Comfort officially ended two months after it began. Iraqi Kurd Population and Operation Provide Comfort II. Operation Provide Comfort II began
the day Operation Provide Comfort ended. The primary focus for this operation was to prevent
Iraqi aggression against the Kurds once they returned to their country. The operation ended
officially on 31 December 1996 at the request of the Turkish Government who wanted to improve
relations with Iran and Iraq. To accommodate the request, while still providing support and
security to the region, Operation Provide Comfort II was followed by Operation Northern Watch, which began on 1 January 1997, with the mission of enforcing the northern no-fly zone. No-Fly Zones over Iraq and Operations Southern and
Northern Watch. Operation Southern Watch began on 27
August 1992 and lasted until 19 March 2003. Operation
Southern Watch began one day after President Bush announced
a no-fly zone in Southern Iraq in support of United Nations
Security Council Resolution 688, to discourage renewed Iraqi
military activity near Kuwait. The resolution protected Shiite
Muslims under aerial attack from the Iraqi regime. Operation
Northern Watch was initiated by President William J. Clinton
to establish no-fly zones north of the 36th parallel. The
expansion meant that most of Iraqi airspace fell into no-fly
zones. Operation Northern Watch lasted until 17 March 2003. It officially ended two days before Operation Iraqi Freedom
began. Figure 3.2. is provided to show the northern and southern no-fly zones. Figure 3.2. Iraq No-Fly Zones

### Military Support and Humanitarian Relief
While engaged with the Gulf War, including participation in operations for many years in the
region following the Gulf War, the USAF was also providing military support and humanitarian
relief around the world. Bay of Bengal Typhoon and Operation Sea Angel. In addition to the Gulf War, the USAF
performed a number of humanitarian missions to various countries around the world. In 1991, a
typhoon swept over Bangladesh with thunderstorms and winds of up to 150 mph, causing damages
estimated to be $1.5 billion. The typhoon caused a 20-foot storm surge over the country, killing
138,000 people and destroying homes of more than 10 million others. In response to the
devastation, the Airmen, Marines, and Sailors, delivered 3,000 tons of supplies to Bangladesh
during Operation Sea Angel. Soviet Union Support and Operation Provide Hope. Operation Provide Hope began in 1992. The former Soviet Union was transitioning from a Communist country to a capitalist nation that
left much of its population struggling for survival. Not only were people living in the capital cities
suffering, but there was also dire need of support in the outlying cities as well. The Operation
Provide Hope airlift mission lasted approximately two weeks, with the ongoing efforts of helping
build sustainable medical services lasting almost two years. The operation ultimately provided
25,000 tons of food, medicine, and other cargo to the former Soviet Union. Somalia Relief and Operation Provide Relief. In 1992, unrest in the wake of a two-year civil
war contributed to a famine in Somalia that killed up to 350,000 people. As many as 80,000
refugees fled the stricken country. The United Nations led a relief effort in July 1992 to address
the suffering of refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border and in Somalia itself. The United States
initiated Operation Provide Relief two months later. By December, 19,000 tons of food were
airlifted into the region, often under the hail of small arms fire. Civil war and clan fighting
prevented much of the supplies from getting into the hands of those who desperately needed them. Somalia Relief and Operations Impressive Lift & Restore Hope I. In September 1992, to
address the issues of famine in Somalia, the United States initiated Operation Impressive Lift to
airlift hundreds of Pakistani soldiers under the United Nations banner to provide aid in Somalia. Despite efforts and increased security from the United Nations, the problems continued. On 4
December 1992, President Bush authorized Operation Restore Hope to establish order in Somalia
so that food could reach those in need. With U.S. Marines on the ground and with control of the
airport, flights were able to resume. During Operation Restore Hope, we airlifted 32,000 of our
troops into Somalia. By 4 May 1993, fewer than 5,000 remained when it officially ended. Somalia Relief and Operation Restore Hope II. After Operation Restore Hope ended, factional
fighting within Somalia continued, causing relief efforts to unravel yet again. On 3 October 1993, U.S. Special Forces, to capture members of a dangerous, disruptive clan, returned to Somalia. The
team lost 18 personnel and suffered 84 wounded. In response, during Operation Restore Hope II
we airlifted 1,700 of our troops and 3,100 tons of cargo into Mogadishu between 5 and 13 October
## to stabilize the situation. President Clinton refused to commit the United States to nation
building and Operation Restore Hope II officially ended 25 March 1994 when the last C-5 departed
Mogadishu. While Operation Restore Hope II allowed our troops to get out of the country without
further casualties, anarchy ruled, and the threat of famine remained in Somalia. <!-- Page 62 -->

Notable Bravery in Somalia, Timothy A. Wilkinson. In the late
afternoon of 3 October 1993, Timothy A. Wilkinson, a pararescueman
with the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, responded with his crew to the
downing of a UH-60 helicopter in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. Wilkinson was repeatedly exposed to intense enemy small arms fire
while extracting the injured and mortally wounded from the crashed
helicopter. Despite his own injuries, he provided life-saving medical
treatment to the crewmembers, then turned to the ranger security
element engaged in an intense firefight across an open four-way
intersection from his position where he began immediate medical treatment. His personal
courage and bravery under heavy enemy fire were integral to the success of all casualty treatment
and evacuation efforts conducted in the intense 18-hour combat engagement. Master Sergeant
Wilkinson was awarded the Air Force Cross for his heroic actions. Timothy Wilkinson
Eastern Europe Stabilization and Operation Provide Promise. Leading up to the initiation of
Operation Provide Promise, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, coupled with the
disintegration of the Soviet Union itself, dissolved the political bind that tied ethnically diverse
Yugoslavia as a single nation. Roman Catholic Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence
from the Yugoslav Federation that was dominated by Eastern Orthodox Serbia. In early 1992, predominantly Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina (Bosnia) also severed ties with the Federation. Fearing their minority status, Serbs within Bosnia reacted by enforcing their ethnic state, seizing
territory, and besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. In July 1992, the United States became
involved with the United Nation’s efforts in Operation Provide Promise. C-130 crews on 3-week
deployments flew out of Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany to deliver food and medical supplies to
the region. The effort was supported by 15 additional countries also airlifting relief supplies to
Sarajevo. Briefly, to supplement efforts, Operation Provide Santa kicked off in December 1993
when C-130s dropped 50 tons of toys and children’s clothing and shoes. On 14 December 1995, warring factions signed peace accords at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, calling for an
end to humanitarian air-land deliveries into Sarajevo. During Operation Provide Promise, aircraft
supporting the United Nation’s relief operation withstood 279 incidents of ground fire and was the
longest running humanitarian airlift in history, lasting over three and a half years. War in Bosnia and Operation Deny Flight. On 12 April 1993, Operation Deny Flight began as
a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) effort to limit the war in Bosnia through imposition
of a no-fly zone over the country and served to provide close air support for United Nation’s troops
in Bosnia. The mission faced challenges, particularly when Bosnian Serbs took lightly armed
United Nation’s forces hostage to use as leverage against continued airstrikes. The United Nations
agreed to veto further strikes on the Serbs, but the mission was still taking strikes from Serb
aggressors. Operation Deny Flight ended on 20 December 1995, bringing a close to the 100,000
sorties flown in efforts of ending turmoil in the region. Haitian Control and Operation Uphold Democracy. On 8 September 1994, the United States
launched Operation Uphold Democracy to remove the military regime that had overthrown Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The U.S. Atlantic Command developed two different plans, one
for forcible entry and the other for passive entry. While USAF planners worked through variations
of both invasion strategies, an aerial force of more than 200 aircraft were activated to bear an
overwhelming force of strength, if needed. At nearly the last minute, a diplomatic proposal offered
by former President James E. Carter, persuaded the military leader in Haiti to relinquish control. This move allowed the mission to be implemented as an insertion of a multinational peacekeeping
force and application of the passive-entry plan. The successful adaptation to airlifting
peacekeeping troops was a major indicator of the flexibility airpower offers military and political

leaders in fulfilling foreign policy objectives. U. S. Air Force involvement effectively ended 12
October 1994. Three days later, the Haitian President returned to his country. Kuwaiti Border Protection and Operation Vigilant Warrior. In October 1994, Iraqi troops, including the elite Iraqi Republican Guard, massed at the Kuwaiti border. Saddam Hussein had
begun aggressive posturing for power once again. The United States responded with Operation
Vigilant Warrior. Thousands of additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel entered into the theater. As a result of the American response, Kuwait was not invaded, and Iraq recalled its ground forces
away from the border. Operation Vigilant Warrior officially ended on 15 December 1994. Bosnian Serb Attacks and Operation Deliberate Force. In 1995, after a mortar shell killed 37
civilians in Sarajevo, Operation Deliberate Force served notice to Bosnian Serb forces that they
would be held accountable for their actions. Operation Deliberate Force airstrikes were launched
against Bosnian Serb targets throughout the country. This was the first campaign in aerial warfare
where precision munitions outweighed conventional bombs. The incessant air campaign garnered
the desired results. Operation Deliberate Force played a key role in ending the war in Bosnia. On
## September that same year, the Serbs agreed to NATO terms and the bombing stopped. Operation Deliberate Force officially ended on 21 September 1995. Kurd Genocide Protection and Operation Desert Strike. In August 1996, Saddam Hussein
ordered an attack on the city of Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. This attack stoked American fears of a
genocidal campaign against the Kurds, similar to the campaigns of 1988 and 1991. It also placed
Saddam in clear violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, forbidding
repression of Iraq’s ethnic minorities. Operation Desert Strike launched a series of strikes against
Saddam. In that same timeframe, Operation Pacific Haven, often referred to as Operation Quick
Transit, began a multi-stage effort to provide airlift for as many as 7,000 displaced Kurds to safe
areas. Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction and Operation Desert Fox. Operation Desert Fox was a
four-day bombing campaign in 1998, directed at facilities in Iraq believed to be used to produce
weapons of mass destruction. The strike was initiated as a result of Saddam Hussein’s resistance
to comply with United Nations Security Council and the inspection teams. Operation Desert Fox
was the largest strike against Iraq in several years. Criticism was received on several accounts as
to the extent, methods, intentions, and outcomes of the attack. Ultimately, the highly effective
actions taken during the operation were deemed to be a success. Serb Ethnic Violence Prevention and Operation Allied Force. After the post-Cold War breakup
of Yugoslavia, the Serbian government’s gradual oppression over the ethnic Albanian population
for almost a decade eventually escalated to violence and mass killings. The international
community began to negotiate with Serbian leaders in the spring of 1998 for a solution acceptable
to all parties. The Serbs, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, considered the matter an internal
one. A final effort to negotiate a settlement began in January 1999 at Rambouillet, France, but
talks broke down soon after. When diplomacy failed, NATO worried about the possibility of a
genocidal civil war and destabilization throughout the Balkan region in southeastern Europe. When
President Milosevic unleashed a ruthless offensive designed to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army
and drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, the Allies, faced with a massive humanitarian crisis, turned to airpower. Operation Allied Force began on 24 March 1999 to force Serbia to accept terms to end the conflict
in Kosovo and prevent a repeat of the ethnic cleansing that took place in Bosnia. The operation
was initiated with three objectives: demonstrate opposition to aggression; deter Milosevic from
escalating attacks on civilians; and damage Serbia’s capability to wage war against Kosovo. <!-- Page 64 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
64
Unfortunately, Milosevic’s resolve was underestimated. What was believed to require a few days
of airstrikes turned out to take 78 days, with 30,018 sorties to secure the objective. The primary
factors that led to the conclusion of the operation were unity and resolve. The lesson was clear to
Milosevic that NATO was tough and became progressively tougher throughout the campaign. The precision and persistence of the air campaign was fundamental in convincing Milosevic to
end the fight. <!-- Page 65 -->

### Terrorist Attacks
Khobar Towers. During the night of June 25, 1996, the
bombing of building 131 in the Khobar Towers, Figure 3.3., complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia marked the 1st time that
the USAF was directly targeted by terrorists and was the first
time that the DoD issued purple hearts for a non-combat area. 19 Airmen were killed (2 officers and 17 enlisted) and
hundreds were injured. Unfortunately, this heinous attack
wouldn’t be the last. Figure 3.3. Khobar Towers Attack
Operation Noble Eagle. Terrorism
struck home on 11 September 2001
in a planned attack by Islamic
extremists when Al Qaeda terrorists
hijacked four airliners flying in
United States airspace. Two aircraft
were flown into the towers of the
World Trade Center, one was flown
into the Pentagon, and the fourth
crashed
in
Pennsylvania. Thousands of people
were injured in those events, and
2,996 people died, including the 19
hijackers. In response, President
George W. Bush declared a global war on terrorism. Figure 3.4. is provided to show the timing of
each of the four attacks. Figure 3.4. Terrorist Attacks of 11 September 2001

These unprecedented acts of violence left thousands dead, thousands more grieving, and a nation
unsure of its future vulnerabilities. One thing that was for certain was the depth and scope of radical
Islamic hatred. The United States immediately focused on protecting our homeland from both
internal and external air attacks, and fighter aircraft began flying combat air patrols in the skies
over America in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Thousands of National Guard and Reserve
personnel were mobilized to protect military and civilian assets, including airports, military
installations, and infrastructure. USAF fighter, tanker, and surveillance air assets provided 24-hour
intercept response coverage for virtually the entire country. Months later, North American Aerospace Defense Command, with more than 100 Air National
Guard, USAF Reserve, and RegAF fighters from 26 locations, continued to monitor American
airspace. Across the globe, nations offered support and solidarity as Americans tried to regroup
and move forward in the aftermath of the events of 9/11(the attacks are colloquially referred to as
“9/11”). Examples of bravery and sacrifice continue to circulate to this day of service members
and civilians rescuing comrades from burning buildings, fighting fires, providing medical
attention, comforting survivors, and volunteering to do whatever they could after the tragedy
occurred. <!-- Page 66 -->

### War on Terror – Afghanistan
Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, the United States reported that Osama bin Laden was
behind the worst terrorist attacks in world history. President Bush demanded that the Taliban, Afghanistan’s ruling government, deliver all leaders of al-Qaeda to the U.S. Government, release
all imprisoned foreign nationals, immediately close all terrorist training camps, hand over all
terrorists and supporters to authorities, and allow inspectors full access to terrorist training camps. When the Taliban refused, President Bush ordered military forces to the region. Operation Enduring Freedom. Operation Enduring Freedom took the fight against terrorism to
foreign soil, most notably to locations where terrorist organizations existed in Afghanistan. Operation Enduring Freedom was focused on forming and acting with an international coalition to
remove Afghanistan’s Taliban government. The coalition primarily included forces from the
United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and other nations. The United States sent approximately 350 aircraft to Afghanistan. Several B-1 and B-52 bombers, F-15 and F-16 fighters, special operations aircraft, RQ-1B and RQ-4A unmanned aerial vehicles, and Navy fighters deployed to bases throughout the country. On 7 October 2001, following
continued Taliban refusal to hand over suspected terrorists, United States, British, and French
aircraft began a sustained air campaign against terrorist targets in the country. Operation Enduring
Freedom strikes began with USAF bombers, Navy carrier-strike aircraft, and sea-launched
Tomahawk cruise missiles. The USAF B-52 bombers flew to engagement zones where groundbased forces directed attacks. Guided munitions were employed with great accuracy, enabling air
planners to reduce the number of air sorties required to destroy a particular objective. In the
opening days of the campaign, joint and combined efforts destroyed Taliban air defenses, command centers, and other fixed targets. Combat operations in Afghanistan began with small groups of elite American military forces
deployed to support anti-Taliban Afghani fighters. Afghanistan’s rugged terrain, complex political
relationships, and distance from operating bases challenged coalition forces. USAF combat
controllers were among the 300 Army, Navy, and USAF special operations personnel augmenting
the Afghan Northern Alliance. In November 2001, coalition forces took control of Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. The Taliban resistance began to collapse, and in December 2001, Kandahar
was abandoned, the last major town under Taliban control. Terrorist forces were run underground, but not eliminated, causing ongoing, extended counterinsurgency operations. In addition to being
a combat operation, Operation Enduring Freedom served as a humanitarian mission. Service
members provided humanitarian relief by dropping nearly 2.5 million rations to the oppressed
Afghan people. Operation Enduring Freedom Expands. In January 2002, 1,200 members of U.S. Special
Operations Command, Pacific were deployed to the Philippines to assist the Armed Forces of the
Philippines in uprooting al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, such as Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu
Sayyaf. The mission was to assist military operations against terrorist forces as well as support
humanitarian operations for the Philippine island of Basilan, where most of the conflict was
expected to take place. One American hostage was recovered during the mission, and the Abu
Sayyaf Group was reduced from 800 to 100 members. Efforts from this engagement created 14
schools, 7 clinics, 3 hospitals, and provided medical care to over 18,000 residents of Basilan. War on Terrorism in Africa. Attention was turned to the Horn of Africa in mid-2002, focused

efforts for rebuilding schools and medical facilities, as well as training local forces in
counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics throughout Djibouti, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Operation Anaconda. On 2 March 2002, Operation Anaconda was launched as one of the most
crucial joint combat operations, designed to remove the Taliban resistance from Afghanistan. Operation Anaconda, conducted in the Shahikot Valley, was a complex battle fought in rugged
mountainous terrain under difficult conditions. In the early morning hours, on a mountaintop called
Takur Ghar in southeastern Afghanistan, al Qaeda soldiers fired on an MH-47E helicopter. The
strike on the helicopter caused a Navy SEAL, Petty Officer First Class Neil C. Roberts, to fall
through the open helicopter door to the ground. A chain of events followed during a 17-hour ordeal
culminating in one of the most intense small-unit firefights of the war against terrorism. The press
referred to Operation Anaconda as the battle at Shah-I-Kot Mountain, but the men who fought
there called it the battle of Robert’s Ridge. U.S. Armed Forces involved in this fight distinguished themselves by conspicuous bravery. Their
countless acts of heroism demonstrated America’s best as USAF, Army, and Navy special
operators fought side by side, and in the process, secured the mountaintop and inflicted serious
loss on al Qaeda. Operation Anaconda ended as an American victory, but not without the ultimate
sacrifice of eight Americans and 80 wounded. The difficult early stages of the battle provided
insights for thinking about how to organize, train, and equip military forces for future joint
expeditionary operations and how to pursue transformation. Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Jason D. Cunningham. In 2002, Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham was the primary USAF combat
search and rescue medic, pararescueman assigned to a quick reaction force
tasked to rescue two American servicemen from austere terrain occupied by
Al Qaeda and Taliban forces. Shortly before landing near the village of
Marzak, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, on 4 March Cunningham’s MH47E helicopter took rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire, severely
disabling the aircraft. The assault force formed a hasty defense and the team
immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties. Facing
enemy fire, risking his own life, Cunningham remained in the burning
fuselage to treat the wounded. He moved his patients to a more secure
location under mortar attack, disregarding extreme danger and exposing himself to enemy fire on
seven separate occasions. When the second casualty collection point was compromised, Cunningham braved intense small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attacks to reposition the
wounded to a third collection point. Mortally wounded and quickly fading, he continued to direct
patient movement while transferring responsibilities to another medic. His selfless efforts resulted
in the delivery of 10 gravely wounded Americans to life-saving medical care. The Secretary of
the USAF posthumously awarded Senior Airman Cunningham the Air Force Cross for his
extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force. Jason D. Cunningham
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, John A. Chapman. On 4 March 2002, during Operation Anaconda, after being fired upon by al Qaeda and losing
a Navy SEAL, John A. Chapman’s MH- 47E helicopter landed just under
five miles away. Once on the ground, Chapman provided directions to
another helicopter to pick them up, successfully rescuing their mission team
member from the enemy stronghold. Chapman killed two enemy soldiers, and without regard for his own life, kept advancing toward a dug-in
machinegun nest when the team came under fire from three directions. Chapman exchanged fire from minimal personal cover and succumbed to

multiple wounds. His engagement and destruction of the first enemy position and advancement to
the second enabled his team to take cover, break enemy contact, and save the lives of the entire
rescue team. On 10 January 2003, the Secretary of the USAF posthumously awarded the Air Force
Cross to Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman. On 22 August 2018, Chapman’s widow accepted
the posthumous upgrade to the Medal of Honor from President Donald J. Trump. Chapman is
the first USAF member to receive this award since the Vietnam Conflict. Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Anissa Shero. Air Commando Anissa
Shero served as a loadmaster aboard an MC-130 Combat Talon II, call sign
Chariot-55, during Operation Enduring Freedom. On June 12, 2002, Chariot-55 was tasked with extracting a three-man U.S. Special Forces
team from a dirt runway near the village of Sardeh Band, Afghanistan. Once on the ground, Shero, and fellow loadmaster Sean Corlew, both from
the 15th Special Operations Squadron, performed an engine-running onload of the team and equipment. After an aborted takeoff attempt, Shero
discovered two soldiers unrestrained and told them to buckle up. Shortly
after, the aircraft took off again, this time crashing. Shero, Corlew, and
U.S. Army Sergeant First Class Peter Tycz died. The two soldiers that
Shero assisted both survived. She was the first female casualty in Operation Enduring
Freedom/Afghanistan. Anissa Shero
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Kevin Whalen. On 19 July
2003, Kevin Whalen, a Tactical Air Control Party Terminal
Attack Controller was supporting an Afghan and U.S. combat
patrol in the Gayan Valley, Afghanistan. The patrol was hit in
a well-coordinated ambush. Whalen returned effective fire with
an automatic grenade launcher and remained exposed to enemy
fire while allowing the rest of the team to take cover. When the
grenade launcher was hit and damaged, Whalen remained at his
post and attempted to fix the launcher. He was hit three times. One bullet hit his body armor, another his Gerber tool, and the third struck him in the left arm. Whalen dropped out of the turret, began first aid to stop the bleeding, and recovered his radio to
call in close air support. When the engagement was over, Whalen insisted that all other wounded
be evacuated first. After two days in the hospital, he returned to his team to continue combat
missions. For his actions, Technical Sergeant Whalen was awarded the Silver Star. Kevin Whalen
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Ramon Colon-Lopez. Ramon ColonLopez, a pararescueman, was deployed to Afghanistan on 11 March 2004, as part of an advanced force operations team serving alongside elements
of the Afghan national strike unit. The mission was to capture a highvalue target (a drug king-pin who was funding terrorism) and prevent the
proliferation of chemical weapons. While conducting operations, Senior
Master Sergeant Colon-Lopez was on the first of four helicopters that took
sustained small-arms fire and was seriously damaged as they landed. With
rounds impacting all around him and unsure of the size of the enemy force, he pressed forward, overrunning enemy positions. His actions suppressed
enemy fire against the other three helicopters and drove the enemy away. The raid resulted in two
enemy kills, 10 enemy apprehensions, and the destruction of rocket-propelled grenades and
small caliber weapons. As a result of his actions, Colon-Lopez received the Bronze Star with Valor
and became one of the first six recipients of, and only Hispanic American, to earn the Combat
Action Medal. He was later promoted to Chief Master Sergeant and served in several leadership

positions, culminating in 2019 as the fourth Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Robert Guiterrez. Robert
Guiterrez, deployed to Heart Province, Afghanistan as a combat
controller assigned to an Army Special Forces Detachment. On 5
October 2009, Gutierrez and his team conducted a high-risk nighttime
raid to capture the number two Taliban leader in the region. During the
initial assault, the team was attacked with a barrage of rifle and heavy
machine-gun fire from a numerically superior and determined enemy
force. Gutierrez was shot in the chest, his team leader was shot in the
leg, and the ten-man element was pinned down in a building with no
escape route. In great pain and confronting the very real possibility that he would die, Gutierrez
seized the initiative and refused to relinquish his duties as joint terminal attack controller. Under
intense fire, he engaged Taliban fighters with his M-4 rifle and brought airpower to bear, controlling three “danger close” A-10 strafing runs with exceptional precision against enemy
forces just 30 feet away. After the first A-10 attack, the team medic performed a needle
decompression to re-inflate Gutierrez’s collapsed lung, allowing him to direct the next two strafe
runs which decimated the enemy force and allowed the team to escape the kill zone without
additional casualties. Throughout the four-hour battle, Gutierrez’s valorous actions, at great risk
to his own life, helped save the lives of his teammates and dealt a crushing blow to the regional
Taliban network. For this action, Guiterrez was awarded the Air Force Cross. Robert Guiterrez
### Afghanistan Troop Withdrawal
In 2011, at the height of American involvement in Afghanistan, 101,000 service members were
deployed to the country. In June 2013, Afghan forces formally took over combat operations. At
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
Headquarters in Kabul, a ceremony marked the end of ISAF’s mission and the transition to the
NATO-led Resolute Support. For most, the war in Afghanistan came to an end in 2014. Throughout Operation Enduring Freedom, 7 October 2001–28 December 2014, coalition
casualties totaled 3,486. Taliban and Al-Qaeda casualties ranged from 25,500 to 40,500. The troop
withdrawal/declared end to war in Afghanistan happened on 31 August 2021. Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Delorean Sheridan. In March 2013, Delorean Sheridan was completing a routine pre-brief for a combat control
mission at his deployed location in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. While
his team loaded gear into their vehicles, an Afghan police officer suddenly
turned and opened fire with a truck-mounted machine gun 25 feet away. Simultaneously, 15 to 20 insurgents just outside the village engaged the
base with heavy machine gunfire. With rounds striking and killing his
teammates, Sheridan closed in on the gunman with a pistol and an M-4
Rifle, neutralizing the immediate threat with deadly accuracy. Still under
heavy attack from outside insurgents, Sheridan exposed himself to heavy machine gunfire
three more times to drag his wounded teammates out of the line of fire to a protected casualty
collection point. Sheridan directed close air support and surveillance aircraft to pinpoint, engage, and eliminate additional insurgents, and directed the entrance and exit of six medical evacuation
helicopters. Sheridan’s calmness and leadership in the face of danger helped save 23 lives. For
these actions, Technical Sergeant Sheridan was awarded the Silver Star. He also received one
of the USAF’s most prestigious awards, the 2013 Lance P. Sijan USAF Leadership Award. Lastly, he was selected as one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year for 2014. Delorean Sheridan

Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. After the deadline for troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, roughly 300 American Airmen stayed in Afghanistan to carry out operations against remnants of
Al Qaeda and help stand up the Afghan Air Force. In 2015, combat operations of Operation
Enduring Freedom were replaced by Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. Working with NATO’s
Operation Resolute Support, 28 NATO nations, 14 partner nations, and 11,000 American troops
continued the mission of training, advising, and assisting the Afghan Air Force to help it become
fully independent. Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Alexey Germanovich. Alexey
Germanovich, a Joint Terminal Attack Controller, was deployed to
the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan as a part of the Afghanistan
Combined Joint Special Operations Air Component. On the morning
of 8 April 2017, Germanovich and his team came under intense
machine gun and sniper fire. A ferocious firefight ensued, enveloping
friendly forces with countless enemy fighting positions as insurgents
continued to reinforce from all sides of the valley. Without hesitation, he deliberately placed himself in grave danger by sprinting towards
his isolated teammates, traversing 70 meters of open terrain and a
fusillade of machine gun fire. He directed multiple strafing runs, with 500-pound and 2,000-pound
bomb strikes as close as 90 meters from his position. As his team member was mortally wounded, Germanovich placed himself between the enemy and the pinned down friendly forces, protecting
them with his body and employing his own suppressive fire. As the team’s ammunition
dwindled, Germanovich directed close air support as close as 20 meters from his position, neutralizing the enemy. Finally, he coordinated a medical evacuation of helicopters to extract the
wounded and helped carry a Soldier 700 meters uphill to the landing zone as he continued to call
for close air support. His actions directly resulted in the protection of over 150 friendly forces and
the lethal engagement of 11 separate fighting positions. As a result of his actions, Alexey
Germanovich was awarded the Air Force Cross. Alexey Germanovich
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Daniel Keller. Daniel Keller, a Joint
Terminal Attack Controller attached to a combined joint special operations
assault force at Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. On 16 August 2017, Keller embarked on a clearance operation against 350 Islamic State
fighters. After fifteen hours of sustained contact, the assault force struck a
house-borne improvised explosive device killing four personnel and
wounding thirty-one. After being knocked over by the blast and struggling
to his feet, he executed air to ground engagements while returning fire with
his M4 rifle. Keller helped move thirteen critically wounded casualties to
a helicopter landing zone under a hail of enemy fire. Upon noticing
the medical evacuation helicopters were unable to identify the landing
zone, he exposed himself to enemy fire in order to marshal in both aircraft. After the mission had
been aborted and despite his injuries, Keller loaded wounded personnel into vehicles and
volunteered to walk two and a half kilometers back to a combat outpost while escorting other
wounded teammates. During this movement, Keller repulsed a three-sided enemy attack by
returning fire and simultaneously passed enemy positions to another Joint Terminal Attack
Controller, allowing friendly forces to break contact. As a result of his actions, Daniel Keller was
awarded the Air Force Cross. Daniel Keller

### War on Terror – Iraq
Operation Iraqi Freedom. In March 2003, after receiving intelligence reports that Saddam
Hussein possessed or was building weapons of mass destruction, President Bush announced a 48hour ultimatum for him and his sons to leave Iraq or face severe consequences. When Saddam
refused to comply, a coalition of American and Allied forces entered Iraq to end the Hussein
regime and free the Iraqi people. The primary goals of Operation Iraqi Freedom were to create a
stable Iraq, empower a broad-based government that renounces weapons of mass destruction, and
rebuke terrorism to neighboring countries. Combined force commanders carried out objectives to
defeat or compel capitulation of Iraqi forces, neutralize regime leadership, and neutralize Iraqi
theater ballistic missile/weapons of mass destruction delivery systems. More than 300,000 troops were deployed to the Gulf region to form a multinational coalition, and
Operation Iraqi Freedom officially began on 20 March 2003. On the first day, while British forces
took Basra, which was essential to delivering humanitarian aid, the United States unleashed air
strikes so devastating that Saddam’s soldiers were left unable or unwilling to fight. Between 300
and 400 cruise missiles were fired at targets, more than the number launched during the entire first
Gulf War. On the second day, the battle plan called for launching another 300 to 400 missiles, what the National Defense University referred to as shock and awe. The plan was focused on the
psychological destruction of the enemy’s will to fight rather than the physical destruction of the
opposing military force. The concept relied on a large number of precision-guided weapons hitting
the enemy simultaneously, an approach that takes minutes instead of days or weeks. By 9 April 2003, American commanders declared that Saddam’s regime was no longer in control
of Baghdad. Before the city fell, jubilant crowds toppled a 40-foot statue of Saddam. Also, Iraq’s
science advisor, the first on the 55 most-wanted leaders list issued by the coalition, surrendered. In less than one month, our military forces rolled past Iraq’s Republican Guard, seized bridges
over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and commandeered Saddam International Airport. With
control of the airport, major operations were conducted to eliminate insurgent centers of activity. Notable Bravery in Iraq, Scott D. Sather. Scott D. Sather led a
reconnaissance task force into Iraq on the first day of the ground war of
Operation Iraqi Freedom, breeching enemy fortifications during the border
crossing. During the next several days, Sather covered countless miles
conducting specialized reconnaissance in the Southwestern Iraqi desert in
support of classified missions. Sather was then employed to an area of
heavy enemy concentration, tasked to provide critical reconnaissance and
intelligence on enemy movement, supporting direct action missions
against enemy forces. Sather’s phenomenal leadership and bravery on the
battlefield throughout his deployment were instrumental in the resounding
successes of numerous combat missions by performing a significant role in the success of the war
and the complete overthrow of the Iraqi regime. Staff Sergeant Scott Sather died on 8 April 2003. He was the first Airman killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He earned seven medals during his
USAF career, including the Bronze Star. Scott Sather

Notable Bravery in Iraq, Elizabeth Jacobson. Three months into her
deployment, security forces member, Elizabeth Jacobson, was guarding a
convoy enroute from Camp Bucca, Iraq as a member of the off-base convoy
support team. The convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device near
Safwan, Iraq. On 28 September 2005, A1C Jacobson was the first security
forces Airman and first female Airman to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom. She served in the USAF two years. The Elizabeth N. Jacobson Award for
Expeditionary Excellence was established in her honor. The award is given
to Airmen for outstanding performance during a deployment. 3.20. Operation Iraqi Freedom Continues

The United States involvement in Iraq maintained focused on controlling insurgents and enabling
the country to rebuild its constitution and government. Fifty-four USAF personnel died in the Iraq
War. In 2003, Saddam Hussein was found and captured; he was tried and executed three years
later. With instability raging out of control in the region, primarily between Shias and Sunnis, the
country became a breeding-ground for terrorist activities once again. The United States intervened
with a surge of force in 2007 to deescalate the situation. Operation New Dawn. On 1 September 2010, operations transitioned from Operation Iraqi
Freedom to Operation New Dawn, signifying a formal end to United States involvement in the
military combat operations. The transition to a supporting role and stability operations was made
possible by increased capability of Iraqi security forces and their improved ability to combat
terrorists and provide security for their people. As part of Operation New Dawn, our military had
three primary missions: advising, assisting, and training the Iraqi security forces; conducting
partnered counterterrorism operations; and providing support to provincial reconstruction teams
and civilian partners as they helped build Iraq’s civil capacity. As mandated under the terms of a
bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President Bush, troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed
on 18 December 2011. 3.21. War on Terror – Libya
Operation Odyssey Dawn. On 20 March 2011, under Operation Odyssey Dawn, a collection of
aircraft was launched to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, centered on
protecting Libyan citizens from further harm under Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. Following an
initial launch of Tomahawk missiles, aircraft conducted strikes on a variety of strategic targets
over Libya and created an airspace where no enemy forces could advance on Libyan opposition
troops. On 31 March 2011, the United States passed complete military command of the operation
and control of the no-fly zone to NATO and took up a supporting role for the remainder of the
operation, which was carried out under the name Operation Unified Protector. 3.22. War on Terror – Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
Operation Inherent Resolve. In 2014, a new and ominous threat emerged that resulted in the
involvement of the United States in operations in the skies over Iraq once again. This time, the
enemy, calling themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), was an extremist Sunni
jihadist organization. Aided by a number of worldwide recruits and sympathizers, ISIL gained
control of territory in Syria and Northern Iraq and left savage atrocities in their wake, including
mass murders and ruthless executions of innocent civilians. ISIL was estimated to have an annual
budget of more than $1,000,000,000 and a force of more than 30,000 fighters. Their brutality
resulted in nearly universal condemnation—even Al Qaeda repudiated them. President Barack H. Obama authorized the use of force, in cooperation with partner nations, to conduct carefully
targeted air strikes over Iraq and Syria and thwart their destructive agenda. <!-- Page 73 -->

### First Female Space Shuttle Commander, Eileen M. Collins. Eileen M. Collins, a USAF officer and NASA astronaut, was the first
woman to command a space shuttle mission. She became an astronaut
in 1991, was initially assigned to the orbiter engineering support team, and led several offices while working on the spacecraft program. On 311 February 1995, aboard the spacecraft Discovery, Colonel Collins
flew the first flight of the Russian-American space program. On 15-24
May 1997, aboard the spacecraft Atlantis, Colonel Collins flew on
NASAs sixth shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian
Space Station, Mir. On 22-27 July 1999, aboard the spacecraft Columbia, Colonel Collins
became the first woman to command a shuttle mission. On 26 July-9 August 2005, aboard
the spacecraft Discovery, Colonel Collins was a member of the crew that conducted the returnto- flight mission during which the shuttle docked with the International Space Station. By the
time she retired from NASA in 2006, Colonel Collins logged more than 6,750 hours in 30 different
types of aircraft and conducted four space flights, logging over 872 hours in space. Colonel Collins
has been recognized as one of the top 300 women in history who has had an impact on changing
the world. Eileen M. Collins
### USAF Welcomes First and Only Enlisted Female Pilot
On 4 August 2017, Courtney Farley became the first and only enlisted
female pilot. She is one of 12 hand-picked individuals to enter pilot training
since World War II. Farley has since commissioned and currently pilots
the RQ-4 Global Hawk. 3.25. DELETED. Courtney Farley
