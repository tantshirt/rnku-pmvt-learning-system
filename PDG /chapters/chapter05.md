### Command Authority
Since the birth of our nation, policies and directives have been made by civilians assigned to the
military and to the executive and legislative branches of the government. Command authority is
the established levels of responsibility for command, control, and communication throughout a
chain of command. Responsibility and authority for the U.S. Armed Forces extends from the U.S. President, through the Secretary of Defense, through two distinct branches of command, and
through each commander at every level in the branches of service. The various levels within the
chain of command have different responsibilities and authority; however, each level in the chain
is responsible for all lower levels and accountable to all higher levels. Commander in Chief. The U.S. Constitution establishes the basic principle of civilian control of
the U.S. Armed Forces. As Commander in Chief, the U.S. President has final command authority; however, as head of the executive branch, the President is subject to the checks and balances
system of the legislative and judicial branches. Chain of Command. By statute, the chain of command runs from the U.S. President, through the
Secretary of Defense, to the Combatant Commanders (CCDR). For all forces not assigned to the
CCDRs, the chain of command runs from the U.S. President, through the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments. When forces are assigned to the CCDRs, administrative control over those forces still typically flows through their respective service
branch. Note: A provision of the Public Law 99-433, Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense
Reorganization Act of 1986, 1 October 1986, permits the U.S. President to authorize
communications through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, placing the Chairman in the
communications chain of command. 5.2. Department of Defense
With over 1.3 million members in the Regular Forces, another 826,000 in the National Guard and
Reserve Forces, and 742,000 civilian personnel, the Department of Defense is America’s largest
government agency. The mission of the Department of Defense is to provide military forces to
deter war and protect the security of our country. Headquartered at the Pentagon, the Department
of Defense includes the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Joint
Staff; and the Departments of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps), and Air Force
(including the Space Force). Furthermore, the Department of Defense includes the unified
combatant commands (CCMD) and forces dedicated to combined commands, defense agencies, and field activities. As the civilian head of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense
reports directly to the U.S. President. Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense (SecDef) is appointed by the U.S. President, with
advice and consent of the Senate. The SecDef serves as principal defense policy advisor to the
U.S. President and is responsible for the formulation of general defense policy, policy related to
all matters of direct and primary concern to the Department of Defense, and for the execution of
approved policy. In addition to exercising the operational chain of command between the U.S. President and the CCDRs, a specific responsibility of the SecDef is to provide written policy
<!-- Page 90 -->

guidance for Department of Defense national security objectives and policies, military mission
priorities, and projected levels for available resources. The SecDef also provides the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff with written policy guidance regarding contingency plans. The Secretaries
of the military departments and the CCDRs are provided written guidelines to direct the effective
detection and monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime threats to the national security of the
United States. The Armed Forces Policy Council. The Armed Forces Policy Council assists in matters requiring
a long-range view, formulates broad defense policy, and advises the Secretary of Defense on
policies, as requested. The Armed Forces Policy Council consists of the Secretary of Defense
serving as the Chairman of the Council; the Deputy Secretary of Defense; Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and USAF; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Technology, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; and the Service Chiefs. Under Secretaries of Defense. There are six Under Secretaries of Defense (Policy; Comptroller; Personnel and Readiness; Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S); Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering; and Intelligence) who assist the
Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense receives staff assistance through a number of
special agencies, such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Security Service, and Defense
Logistics Agency, which provide special skills, expertise, and advice. 5.3. Joint Staff
The Joint Staff assists members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in carrying out assigned responsibilities
of strategic direction, unified operation of CCMD, and integration of all branches of the military
into an efficient force. By law, the direction of the Joint Staff rests exclusively with the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chairman normally manages the Joint Staff through the Director
of the Joint Staff. The Director is selected by the Chairman after consultation with other members
of the Joint Chiefs and with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. The Joint Staff consists of
more than 1,500 military and civilian personnel, composed of approximately equal numbers of
officers from the Army, Navy, USAF, and USSF. Marines make up about 20 percent of the
number allocated to the Navy. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. Appointed by the U.S. President, by and with advice and
consent of the Senate, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) holds the grade of General
or Admiral. The CJCS outranks all other officers of the U.S. Armed Forces but may not exercise
military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the U.S. Armed Forces. The CJCS is the
principal military advisor to the U.S. President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary
of Defense. The Secretary of Defense may assign CJCS responsibility for overseeing the activities
of the CCMDs. The CJCS presides over the Joint Chiefs of Staff and objectively furnishes
recommendations and views of the Joint Chiefs to the U.S. President, National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense. Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS), appointed by the U.S. President, by and with advice and consent of the Senate, is a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. The VCJCS performs duties prescribed by the Chairman, with the approval
of the Secretary of Defense. The VCJCS cannot be from the same branch of service as the
Chairman, serves a tour of two years, and may be reappointed for two additional terms. When
required, the VCJCS assumes the role of Acting Chairman in the Chairman’s absence. <!-- Page 91 -->

Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman. Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman (SEAC), is
designated as the highest senior enlisted position in the U.S. Armed Forces. The SEAC is
appointed to serve as an advisor to the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense on all matters
involving Total Force integration, utilization, health of the force, and joint development for
enlisted personnel. The SEAC also serves as a spokesperson to leaders and organizations on
applicable issues affecting enlisted forces. Joint Chiefs of Staff. Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the U.S. President and the
Secretary of Defense, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serve as advisors to the President, Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council. The Joint Chiefs provide the strategic
direction of the U.S. Armed Forces, review major materiel and personnel requirements according
to strategic and logistic requirements, and establish joint doctrine. Members of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff are also responsible for the assignment of logistic responsibilities to the military services, formulation of policies for joint training, and coordination of military education. Members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff are the Chairman; Vice Chairman; Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; Chief of
Naval Operations; Chief of Staff of the USAF; Chief of Space Operations; Commandant of the
Marine Corps; and Chief of the National Guard Bureau. For the Service Chiefs (Chief of Staff of
the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the USAF, Chief of Space Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps), their Joint Chiefs of Staff duties take precedence over all
other duties. Consequently, as the military heads of their respective services, the Joint Chiefs
delegate many duties to their Vice Chiefs while retaining overall responsibility. <!-- Page 92 -->

### Combined Commands
B
C
B
C
C
Combined commands consist of two or more forces or agencies of two or more allies operating
together. Combined missions and responsibilities (including command responsibilities) must
establish, assign, and conform to relevant multinational agreements. Normally, a combined
command operates under the terms of a treaty, alliance, or bilateral agreement between or among
the nations concerned. Examples of combined commands are: North American Aerospace
Defense Command, Combined Forces Command Korea, and Allied Command Operations. 5.7. Unified Combatant Commands
The U.S. President, assisted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff through the Secretary of
Defense, establishes unified CCMDs for the performance of military missions. Unified CCMDs
have a broad, continuing mission composed of forces from two or more military departments. All
units assigned or attached to a unified combatant command remain under the combatant command
authority of the unified combatant command commander and the administrative control authority
of the respective service component commander. Once assigned or attached to a unified
combatant command, a force cannot be transferred except by authority of the Secretary of Defense
or under special procedures with approval of the U.S. President. Unified Command Plan. The Unified Command Plan is a classified executive branch document
prepared by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that assigns missions; planning, training, and operational responsibilities; and geographic areas of responsibilities to CCMDs. The Unified
Command Plan has a significant impact on how CCMDs are organized, trained, and resourced—
areas over which Congress has constitutional authority. The plan is reviewed and updated every
two years. by missions
### Combatant Command Organization
There are currently 11 CCMDs, as
shown in Figure 5.2. They are
established
and
responsibilities based on either a
geographic area of responsibility
(AOR) or function. CCDRs with an
AOR operate in clearly delineated
physical and geographic boundaries
established by the UCP and have a
distinctive regional military focus. Unified CCMDs with an AOR include U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and U.S. Southern
Command. CCMDs based solely on military functions without respect to a specific geographic
region are called functional commands. These commands operate globally across geographic
boundaries and provide unique capabilities to other CCDRs and the Services. The functional
CCMDs include U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Cyber
Command, and U.S. Transportation Command. Figure 5.2. Combatant Commands

## Section 5D — USAF Total Force B B C C C

### One Team
B
C
B
C
C
The USAF Total Force is one team—the USAF. It is comprised of military and civilian members
(including contractors), serving within three components: the RegAF, USAF Reserve, and Air
National Guard. Each component brings talents and capabilities that must be integrated to perform
the USAF mission. Elevated requirements and the demands of recurring deployments of the Air
National Guard and USAF Reserve over the past few decades have transformed a traditionally
strategic Reserve Force into a force that provides operational capability, strategic depth, and surge
capacity. Airpower cannot be applied efficiently and effectively without the contributions of each
component working together. RegAF, Reserve, and Guard Airmen have deployed and fought as one team for decades and are
nearly indistinguishable on the battlefield. Additionally, civilian Airmen work side by side daily
with their military counterparts and are critical to mission success. Civilian employees provide
invaluable experience, continuity, and leadership in all mission sets, and contribute a viewpoint
that expands the USAF perspective and enhances our capability to solve problems, adapt to new
challenges, and achieve mission success. Leveraging the strength of the Total Force maximizes the use and synergy of agile Airmen and
resources. Organizations designed under Total Force integration share equipment, facilities, and
resources to carry out a common mission. Under a classic association, the Regular Component is
the host unit, retaining weapon system responsibility, while sharing the mission with a Reserve or
Guard tenant unit. Under an active association, the Reserve or Guard unit is host, with a Regular
Component tenant. Integrating with the Regular Component in this way yields numerous
synergistic benefits to the USAF’s strength, including an improved ability to respond with surge
capacity at a moment’s notice. 5.11. Air Reserve Component
The Air National Guard and USAF Reserve form a significant part of our aerospace capability as
the Air Reserve Component. Forces are drawn from the Air Reserve Component when
circumstances require the RegAF to rapidly deploy. Air Reserve Components are staffed and
trained to meet the same training standards and readiness levels as RegAF Component Forces and
are supplied with the same equipment on an equal priority. The RegAF can only withdraw, divert, or reassign equipment for other commitments with the Secretary of Defense’s written approval. To ensure responsiveness and combat readiness, Air Reserve Components are continuously
evaluated and modernized. Air Reserve Component units are sometimes separated to take
advantage of state or regional demographics and are not centralized at major, multi-squadron
bases, as is the case with RegAF resources. This exception is beneficial because it implements a
strong relationship with the civilian community and builds public support for the USAF as a whole. Command of non-mobilized USAF Reserve units is exercised through the Commander, USAF
Reserve Command, who, in turn, is responsible to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Command
of non-mobilized USAF Reserve Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) is exercised
concurrently through USAF Reserve Command and the unit of attachment. Whenever the
President authorizes mobilization IAW Title 10 U.S. Code, the Secretary of Defense can delegate
call-up authority to the service Secretaries. In that case, the Secretary of the Air Force would be
<!-- Page 99 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
99
authorized to call Air National Guard and USAF Reserve Forces to RegAF status. When activated, operational command of Air Reserve Components transfers to the gaining commander, who is also
responsible for establishing training resources for all assigned or attached Air Reserve
Components. Note: The seven Reserve Components of the U.S. Armed Forces are: Army
National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, USAF
Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. Air National Guard. The National Guard Bureau is a joint activity of the Department of Defense, located in the Pentagon. As one of the Reserve Components of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Air
National Guard (https://www.goang.com/) is often called upon to augment the RegAF
Components in the performance of their missions. The Air National Guard has more than 105,000
officers and enlisted members who serve in 90 flying units and 579 mission support units. The
primary sources of full-time support for Air National Guard units are the dual-status military
technicians. These personnel perform day- to-day organization, administration, recruitment, instruction, training, and maintenance support for the unit. By law, dual-status military technicians
are civil service employees of the federal government who must be military members of the unit
that employs them. Technicians train with the unit and are mobilized with the unit when
federalized. Dual Federal and State Mission. The Air National Guard’s dual federal and state mission, a
provision of the U.S. Constitution, results in each Guardsman holding membership in the National
Guard of his or her state and in the U.S. National Guard. The Air National Guard's federal mission
is to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for prompt mobilization during war, and
provide assistance during national emergencies, such as natural disasters or civil disturbances. During peacetime, the combat-ready units and support units are assigned to most major commands
to carry out missions compatible with training, mobilization readiness, humanitarian, and
contingency operations. When Air National Guard units are not mobilized or under federal control, command jurisdiction
for these units is vested in the governor of the state, commonwealth, or possession. As the
Governor of the District of Columbia, the U.S. President has command jurisdiction over Air
National Guard units. The U.S. President delegates this authority to the Secretary of the Army as
Governor of the District of Columbia. Each of the 54 National Guard organizations is supervised
by the adjutant general of the state or territory. Under state law, the Air National Guard provides
protection of life and property, and preserves peace, order, and public safety. These missions are
accomplished through emergency relief support during natural disasters; search and rescue
operations; support to civil defense authorities; maintenance of vital public services; and
counterdrug operations. USAF Reserve. The Chief of USAF Reserve, HAF, Pentagon, serves as the principal advisor on
reserve matters to the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The USAF
Reserve (https://www.airforce.com/ways-to-serve/air-force-reserve) consists of officers, enlisted, and civil servants who are tasked, by law, to fill the needs of the U.S. Armed Forces whenever
more units and people are required than are available within the RegAF. More than 835,300 people
make up the Ready, Standby, and Retired Reserve. This includes nearly 70,300 Selected
Reservists who are “ready-now” for participating in every job specialty and on the front lines of
daily military operations around the globe. The USAF Reserve is a combat-ready force, stationed
at 66 locations throughout the United States, and serving globally for every CCMD in air and
cyberspace. Today and in recent years, Reservists have supported every USAF core function and every CCDR
around the world. USAF Reservists safeguard nuclear weapons and guide global positioning

satellites. Reservists fly remotely piloted aircraft in combat half a world away, track hurricanes
out at sea, and bring medical supplies and food into disaster areas to save lives. For more than 75
years, the USAF Reserve has fulfilled the legacy of early air pioneers and exceeded the potential
seen by the visionaries who created it. 5.12. Civil Air Patrol/USAF Auxiliary
The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a congressionally chartered, non-profit corporation under 36 U.S.C. § 40301. CAP is also designated the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the USAF when CAP services
are utilized by any department or agency of the Federal government. The Secretary of the Air
Force can employ the services of CAP in lieu of, or to supplement, USAF resources to fulfill the
non-combat programs and missions of the USAF. As a Total Force partner, when approved and
assigned by the USAF, CAP conducts missions as Airmen of the USAF Auxiliary, aligned under
Air Combat Command for fiscal and operational oversight and utilization. CAP has over 55,000
senior member and cadet volunteers, maintains a fleet of over 550 aircraft and over 1000 vehicles, manages multiple nationwide communications capabilities, and maintains a state-of-the-art cell
phone forensics cell. Three primary programs managed by CAP involve emergency services and civil support, aerospace education, and cadet programs. The emergency services and civil support programs
maintain the ability to meet USAF requirements to assist federal, state, local, and nongovernmental organizations during routine and emergency situations in support of homeland
security operations, consequence management, and search and rescue. Aerospace education
provides aviation-focused materials for both senior and cadet members, as well as the general
public. The cadet program is designed to motivate American youth to become responsible citizens
through aviation-centered activities. CAP is organized into eight geographic regions led by regional commanders, and 52 state-level
wings, to include the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico / U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately
1,400 total individual units comprise the lower-level echelons within the state-level wings. Note: The four civilian auxiliaries of the U.S. Armed Forces are: Civil Air Patrol, Coast Guard Auxiliary, Merchant Marine, and Military Auxiliary Radio System. 5.13. Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps
The Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) mission is to develop citizens
of character dedicated to serving the nation and community. The AFJROTC program is a Title 10
United States Code, Armed Forces, mandated citizenship training program open to 9th-12th grade
students that provides leadership training and an aerospace science program for high school
students to explore the historic and scientific aspects of aerospace technology and teaches selfreliance, self-discipline, and other characteristics found in good leaders. These objectives are
achieved through classroom education and instruction in air and space fundamentals and hands-on
learning opportunities in a number of fun and challenging extra-curricular activities. Secondary
school students who enroll in the AFJROTC program are offered a wide variety of curricular and
extra-curricular activities. The AFJROTC staff includes 31 personnel assigned to headquarters and more than 1,900 retired
USAF officer and enlisted military instructors. There are 870 AFJROTC units representing the Air
and Space Forces (approximately 860 represent the USAF while the other 10 represent the Space
Force) with nearly 120,000 cadets in high schools across the United States and selected
Department of Defense dependent schools in Europe and the Pacific, as well as public schools in
Puerto Rico and Guam. The AFJROTC program is not a recruiting or accession tool for the military
services as students who participate in the program incur no military service obligation. <!-- Page 101 -->

Title 10 United States Code, Armed Forces, provides specified duties, responsibilities, and legal
obligations of the Department of the Air Force. The USAF’s mission is to fly, fight, and
win…airpower anytime, anywhere. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is comprised of the
secretariat (including the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary’s principal staff), HAF and
field units, and Headquarters Space Force and field units. It is responsible for preparing the air, space, and cyber forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war and military operations short
of war for the expansion of the peacetime components of the USAF and Space Force to meet the
needs of war. DAF consists of three major entities: the Secretariat (including the Secretary of the
Air Force and the Secretary’s principal staff) and the Air Staff (headed by the Chief of Staff of the
Air Force), and the Space Staff (headed by the Chief of Space Operations). Field units are the
component organizations within the USAF and Space Force. USAF Primary Functions. In addition to general and specific functions of the military branches
outlined in the Key West Agreement, there are also primary functions of the branches. The primary
functions of the USAF include, but are not limited to organizing, training, equipping, and
providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and
missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required, to enable, the
conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, and special operations forces; conduct
nuclear operations in support of strategic deterrence; conduct global precision attack, to include
strategic attack, interdiction, close air support, and prompt global strike; provide timely, global
integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability; provide rapid global mobility
to employ and sustain organic air and space forces and other Military Services, to include airlift
forces for airborne operations, air logistical support, tanker forces for in-flight refueling, and
aeromedical evacuation; provide agile combat support to enhance the air and space campaign and
the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of air forces; conduct global
personnel recovery operations including theater-wide combat and civil search and rescue; and
conduct global integrated command and control for air and space operations. As stated in AFI 1-1, the USAF will be a trusted and reliable joint partner with our sister services
known for integrity in all activities, including supporting the joint mission first and foremost. USAF provides compelling air and cyber capabilities for use by the CCDRs. USAF will excel as
stewards of all USAF resources in service to the American people, while providing precise and
reliable Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power for the nation. Secretary of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) is a civilian appointed by the
U.S. President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The SecAF is the head of the
Department of the Air Force and is subject to the authority, control, and direction of the Secretary
of Defense. Responsibilities of the SecAF include recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping
(including research and development), training, servicing, mobilizing, demobilizing, and
administering personnel (morale and welfare programs); maintaining, constructing, outfitting, and
repairing military equipment; constructing, maintaining, and repairing buildings, structures, and
utilities; and acquiring real property and interests in real property. <!-- Page 102 -->

### Levels of Command and Responsibility
Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) is a USAF General
Officer appointed for four years by the U.S. President, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate. The CSAF is subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of the Air
Force, and presides over the Air Staff. The CSAF acts as an agent in carrying out recommendations
or plans by the Secretary, and exercises supervision consistent with the authority assigned to
commanders of unified or specified CCMDs and organizations of the USAF. As a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CSAF informs the Secretary of the Air Force regarding military advice
rendered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters affecting the Department of the Air Force to the
extent that such action does not impair the independence or performance of required duties as a
member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Air Staff. The Air Staff supports the CSAF in carrying out his or her responsibilities. The Air
Staff is composed of the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs of Staff, Assistant
Chiefs of Staff, Surgeon General of the Air Force, The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, Chief of the Air Force Reserve, and other USAF and civilian employees in the Department of the
Air Force assigned or detailed to the Air Staff. Responsibilities are organized based on functional
two-letter organizations. Some organizations can be merged under one commander/director and
will have similarly merged office symbols. The USAF office symbol codes are provided here: A1 – Manpower, Personnel, and Services
A2/6 – Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Cyber Effects Operations
A3 – Operations
A4 – Logistics, Engineering, and Force Protection
A5/7 – Strategy, Integration, and Requirements
A6 – Communications
A8 – Strategic Plans and Programs
A10 – Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (as designated by USAF)
Field Operating Agencies. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) are USAF subdivisions directly
subordinate to a HAF functional manager. A FOA performs field activities beyond the scope of
major commands. The activities are specialized or associated with a USAF-wide mission and do
not include functions performed in management headquarters (such as Headquarters Air Mobility
Command), unless specifically directed by a Department of Defense authority. Two examples of
FOAs are the Air Force Personnel Center and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Direct Reporting Units. Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are USAF subdivisions directly
subordinate to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit into
any of the major commands but has many of the same administrative and organizational
responsibilities. Two examples of DRUs are the Air Force District of Washington and the USAF
Academy. Note: The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), headquartered at Joint Base
Andrews, Maryland, is a DRU to HAF, reporting to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. AFDW
was reactivated in 2005 to address three broad objectives: align the USAF command structure in
the National Capital Region (NCR) and abroad; improve USAF support to the Joint Force
Headquarters-NCR (JFHQ-NCR); and designate a single voice for USAF cross-service issues in
the NCR. <!-- Page 103 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
103
AFDW serves as the USAF Service Component for coordination purposes to JFHQ-NCR and the
supporting command to the Defense Health Agency National Capital Region Medical Directorate. When the JFHQ-NCR transitions to the Joint Task Force NCR (JTF-NCR), the 320th Air
Expeditionary Wing (320 AEW) activates and becomes the USAF Service Component of JTFNCR. When activated, the Commander of AFDW is dual hatted as the Commander, 320 AEW. Air Force Mission Directive 13 delineates missions and clarifies assigned duties applicable to
AFDW in both its worldwide USAF role and its JTF-NCR USAF Service Component role. Major Commands. Major commands (MAJCOM) are organized functionally in the United States
and geographically overseas. A MAJCOM, as shown in Figure 5.3., represents a major USAF
subdivision having a specific portion of the USAF mission. Each MAJCOM is directly subordinate
to HAF. MAJCOMs are interrelated and complementary, providing offensive, defensive, and
support elements. An operational command consists (in whole or in part) of strategic, tactical, space, or defense forces, or of flying forces that directly support such forces. A support command
may provide supplies, weapon systems, support systems, operational support equipment, combat
material, maintenance, surface transportation, education and training, special services, and other
supported organizations. Within the USAF MAJCOM structure, there are two specialized types of
MAJCOMs: Lead MAJCOMs and Component MAJCOMs. Figure 5.3. Major Commands
Lead MAJCOM. A Lead MAJCOM is the type of MAJCOM that consolidates responsibilities
for a particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire USAF, as applicable. For
example, Air Education and Training Command is the Lead MAJCOM for education and training
for the USAF. Component MAJCOM. A Component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM) is the type of MAJCOM that
is the USAF Component to a unified CCMD. A C-MAJCOM is commanded by the Commander
of Air Force Forces and includes supporting staff, one or more Component Numbered Air Forces
(through which it presents its forces to the CCDR), and all assigned and attached forces. The CMAJCOM integrates, at the strategic level, component activities across all phases of conflict. An
example of a C-MAJCOM is Pacific Air Forces, the USAF Component to United States IndoPacific Command. For additional information on component relationships and roles, refer to AF
Doctrine Volume 1, Command, AF Doctrine Annex 3-30, Command and Control, and AFI 38101. Note: A MAJCOM can be both a Lead MAJCOM and a C-MAJCOM. Air Combat Command. Air Combat Command (ACC) was activated as a MAJCOM on 1 June
1992, and is headquartered at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. ACC is the primary provider of
air combat forces to America's warfighting commanders. ACC’s mission is to support global
implementation of the national security strategy by operating fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle-management, and electronic-combat aircraft. It also provides command, control, communications, and intelligence systems, and conducts global information operations. ACC
organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and
employment while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of
<!-- Page 104 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
104
peacetime air sovereignty and wartime air defense. Additionally, ACC develops strategy, doctrine, concepts, tactics, and procedures for airpower employment. The command provides conventional
and information warfare forces to all unified commands to ensure air and information superiority
for warfighters and national decision-makers. The command can be called upon to assist national
agencies with intelligence, surveillance, and crisis response capabilities. ACC also has
responsibility for inland search and rescue operations in the 48 contiguous states. Overall, ACC
operates more than 1,300 aircraft, 34 wings, 19 bases, and has more than 70 worldwide operating
locations with 94,000 Total Force members. Air Mobility Command. Air Mobility Command (AMC) was activated as a MAJCOM on 1 June
1992, is headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, and is the USAF Component to U.S. Transportation Command. AMC’s mission is to provide global air mobility, the right effects, right
place, right time. The command plays a crucial role in providing humanitarian support at home
and around the world and provides airlift and aerial refueling for all U.S. Armed Forces. Many
special duty and operational support aircraft and stateside aeromedical evacuation missions are
assigned to AMC. This rapid, flexible, and responsive force promotes stability in regions by
keeping America’s capability and character highly visible. Overall, AMC has one Numbered Air
Force, 17 wings, two airlift groups, and one air base group. AMC has nearly 133,700 Total Force
members who make the command's rapid global mobility operations possible. Pacific Air Forces. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) was activated as a MAJCOM on 3 August 1944, is headquartered at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, and is the USAF Component of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. PACAF’s mission is to deliver rapid and precise air and cyberspace
capabilities to protect and defend the United States, its territories, allies, and partners; provide
integrated air and missile warning and defense; promote interoperability throughout the area of
responsibility; maintain strategic access and freedom of movement across all domains; and
respond across the full spectrum of military contingencies to restore regional security. PACAF’s area of responsibility is home to 60 percent of the world’s population in 36 nations across
## percent of the Earth's surface and 16 time zones, with more than 1,000 languages spoken. The
unique location of the strategic triangle (Hawaii-Guam-Alaska) gives our nation persistent
presence and options to project airpower from sovereign territory. PACAF’s Airmen are postured
to deploy at any given time in support of overseas contingency operations, many participating in
non-traditional missions, such as convoy and detainee operations. Overall, PACAF has
approximately 46,000 military and civilian personnel serving in nine strategic locations and
numerous smaller facilities, primarily in Hawaii, Alaska, Japan, Guam, and the Republic of Korea. Approximately 320 fighter, tanker, cargo, air battle management, surveillance, rescue, and attack
aircraft are assigned to the command with approximately 100 additional deployed aircraft rotating
on Guam. United States Air Forces in Europe & Air Forces Africa. United States Air Forces in Europe &
Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) was activated as a MAJCOM on 20 April 2012 and is
headquartered at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. USAFE-AFAFRICA is a combined organization
that provides two separate CCMDs. USAFE is the USAF Service Component to U.S. European
Command, and AFAFRICA is the USAF Service Component to U.S. Africa Command. Both
USAFE and AFAFRICA, which function together as a blended USAFE-AFAFRICA staff, are
commanded by the same General Officer with two separate and distinct roles and authorities. USAFE-AFAFRICA plans, conducts, controls, coordinates, and supports air and space operations
in Europe, parts of Asia, and all of Africa except for Egypt, to achieve United States and North
Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives. As part of its mission, USAFE-AFAFRICA commands
USAF units maintaining combat-ready wings based on Great Britain to Turkey. <!-- Page 105 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
105
USAFE-AFAFRICA directs air operations in a theater spanning three continents, covering more
than 19 million square miles, containing 104 independent states, possessing more than a quarter
of the world's population, and producing more than a quarter of the world’s gross domestic product. Its role in Europe and Africa has expanded from warfighting to humanitarian and peacekeeping
operations, as well as other non-traditional contingencies throughout its area of responsibility. Overall, USAFE-AFAFRICA consists of one Numbered Air Force, seven main operating bases, and 114 geographically separated locations. More than 35,000 Total Force members are assigned
to USAFE-AFAFRICA. Equipment assets include about 217 aircraft and a full complement of
conventional weapons. Air Education and Training Command. On 1 July 1993, the Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) was activated as a MAJCOM and is headquartered at Joint Base San AntonioRandolph, Texas. AETC’s mission is to Recruit, train and educate exceptional Airmen. AETC
develops America’s young men and women who have volunteered to serve their country, into
Airmen, motivating them to embrace the USAF culture by teaching (by our example) the USAF
and USSF core values. AETC’s training mission makes it the first command to touch the lives of
nearly every USAF member. Over the years, more than 25 million students have graduated from
AETC. Overall, AETC includes USAF Recruiting Service, two Numbered Air Forces and the Air
University. AETC operates 12 major installations and supports tenant units on numerous bases
across the globe. Air Force Materiel Command. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) was activated as a
MAJCOM on 1 July 1992 and is headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. AFMC’s mission is to equip the USAF for world-dominant airpower. AFMC delivers war-winning
expeditionary capabilities to the warfighter through development and transition of technology, professional acquisition management, exacting test and evaluation, and world-class sustainment
of all USAF weapon systems. AFMC fulfills its mission of equipping the USAF with the best
weapon systems through the Air Force Research Laboratory and several unique centers which are
responsible for the “cradle-to-grave” oversight for aircraft, electronic systems, missiles, and
munitions. AFMC employs a highly professional and skilled command work force of some 80,000
Total Force members. Air Force Special Operations Command. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)
was activated as a MAJCOM on 22 May 1990, is headquartered at Hurlburt Field, Florida, and is
the USAF Component of U.S. Special Operations Command. AFSOC’s mission is to provide our
nation’s specialized airpower, capable across the spectrum of conflict…any place, anytime, anywhere. AFSOC provides highly trained, rapidly deployable Airmen for global special
operations missions ranging from precision application of firepower to infiltration, exfiltration, resupply, and refueling of operational elements for worldwide deployment and assignment to
regional unified commands. The command's core missions include battlefield air operations; agile
combat support; aviation foreign internal defense; information operations/military information
support operations; precision strike; specialized air mobility; command and control; and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. AFSOC’s priorities are to ensure readiness to
execute global special operations today, transform our force and fleet to maintain relevance
tomorrow, and invest in the resiliency of our force, family, and relationships always. The Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center, headquartered at Hurlburt Field, Florida, organizes, trains, educates, and equips forces to conduct special operations missions; leads
MAJCOM irregular warfare activities; executes special operations test and evaluation and lessons
learned programs; and develops doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures for Air Force special

reconnaissance, pararescuemen, and tactical air control party specialists with other services to
form versatile joint special operations teams. AFSOC has more than 19,500 Total Force members
assigned and operates multiple fixed-wing and rotary-wing assets. Air Force Global Strike Command. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) was activated
as a MAJCOM on 7 August 2009, is headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and
is one of two USAF Service Components of U.S. Strategic Command. AFGSC’s mission is to
provide strategic deterrence, global strike, and combat support…anytime, anywhere. AFGSC is
responsible for the nation’s three intercontinental ballistic missile wings, the USAF’s entire
bomber force, the Long Range Strike Bomber Program, and operational and maintenance support
to organizations within the nuclear enterprise. AFGSC is the guardian of the most powerful
weapons on the planet and is the force provider for two legs of the nuclear triad. AFGSC’s
intercontinental ballistic missile force is postured around the clock to answer the U.S. President’s
call, just as it has been for over 50 years. AFGSC’s bomber fleet remains prepared and equipped
for nuclear deterrence and conventional global strike. Approximately 31,000 professionals are
assigned to two Numbered Air Forces, nine wings, two geographically separated squadrons, one
detachment in the Continental United States, and deployed around the globe. Air Force Reserve Command. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) was activated as a
MAJCOM on 17 February 1997, and is headquartered at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. AFRC’s
mission is to provide combat-ready forces to fly, fight, and win. AFRC provides the USAF
approximately 20 percent of the Total Force for about 5 percent of the manpower budget. Capabilities include nuclear deterrence operations; air and cyberspace superiority; command and
control; global integrated intelligence surveillance reconnaissance; global precision attack; special

Personnel Center, 35 wings, 10 independent groups, various mission support units, and additional
miscellaneous locations and ranges. AFRC has nearly 74,718 Total Force members assigned to
accomplish the demands of its diverse mission. 5.16. Subordinate Levels of Command and Responsibility
Below MAJCOMs are several structured subordinate levels of command, each with an established
purpose and assigned responsibilities to be carried out respectively, as briefly described here. For
additional details on USAF levels of command, refer to AFI 38-101. Numbered Air Force. The Numbered Air Force (NAF) is an administrative level of command
directly under a MAJCOM. NAFs provide intermediate level operational leadership and
supervision. They do not have complete functional staffs. In non-component NAFs, the number of
personnel assigned varies but should not exceed 99 manpower authorizations without an approved
waiver. A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups, and squadrons. USAF Component Numbered/Named Air Forces. A Component NAF (C-NAF), nicknamed as
warfighting headquarters, is structured to perform an operational and warfighting mission in
support of a Joint Force Commander. The 10 USAF C-NAFs are the primary operational-level
warfighting component commands. The C-NAF headquarters normally consists of an Air Force
Forces staff and an assigned air and space operations center or operations center. They are
dedicated to supporting the unified CCDR and subordinate Joint Force Commanders across the
full range of military operations. The C-NAF commander, assigned as the Commander of Air
<!-- Page 107 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
107
Force Forces to a geographic CCMD, will normally also be designated as the theater Joint Force
Air Component Commander. A C-NAF commander may also be designated by the component
commander to command a joint task force, as required. Wing. The wing is a level of command below the Numbered Air Force and has a distinct mission
with significant scope. A wing is responsible for maintaining the installation and may have several
squadrons in more than one dependent group. Wings will have a minimum adjusted population of
at least 1,000 (750 for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command), to include manpower
authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. The different types of wings
are operational, air base, or specialized mission. Operational Wing. An operational wing is one that has an operations group and related
operational mission activity assigned. When an operational wing performs the primary mission of
the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is capable of
self-support in functional areas, such as maintenance and munitions, as needed. When an
operational wing is a tenant unit, the host command typically provides base and logistics support. Air Base Wing. An air base wing performs a support function rather than an operational mission. This type of wing maintains and operates a base. An air base wing often provides functional
support to a MAJCOM headquarters. Specialized Mission Wing. A specialized mission wing performs a specialized mission and
usually does not have aircraft or missiles assigned. Examples include intelligence wings, training
wings, and so on. This wing is either a host or a tenant wing, depending on if it maintains and
operates the base. Group. A group is a level of command below the wing. Like the Numbered Air Force, a group is
a tactical echelon with minimal staff support. A group usually has two or more subordinate units. A dependent group is a mission, logistics, support, medical, or large functional unit, such as a civil
engineer group. Dependent groups may possess small supporting staff elements that are organized
as sections, such as standardization and evaluation or quality control. An independent group has
the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size do not warrant
wing-level designation. Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 400 (200 for
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command), to include manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. Squadron. A squadron is the basic unit, the nucleus, and the basic building block of the USAF. The different types of squadrons are either mission units, such as operational flying squadrons, or
functional units, such as civil engineer, security forces, or logistics readiness squadrons. Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility and should be organized and resourced to allow
Airmen to focus on the USAF mission. Squadrons will have a minimum adjusted population of at
least 35 and can range up to several hundred personnel, which includes manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. Flight. If internal subdivision within a squadron is required, numbered/named, alpha, or functional
flights may be established. Flights typically consist of 12 to 100 people. A numbered or named
flight primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit. The administrative
characteristics for a numbered or named flight include, strength reporting, like those of a squadron. Alpha flights are part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and are composed of several
elements that perform identical missions. Functional flights are usually part of a squadron and are
composed of elements that perform specific missions. <!-- Page 108 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
108
Element. Elements are subdivisions of flights. Typically, flights are broken into three or four
evenly distributed elements, when necessary.
