## Section 20A — Air Force Inspection System B B C C C

### Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP)
The Inspection System of the Department of the Air Force (AFIS) provides commanders with a
credible, independent assessment process with which to measure the capabilities of assigned
forces. As stated in DAFI 90-302, the purpose of AFIS is to enable and strengthen commanders’
mission effectiveness and efficiency; motivate and promote military discipline; improve unit
performance and management excellence throughout the chain of command; and identify, report
on, and analyze issues interfering with readiness, economy, efficiency, discipline, effectiveness, compliance, performance, and surety. Commanders at all levels are required to continuously
evaluate force readiness, as well as organizational economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. Supervisors at all levels play an integral part in this process through continual assessment of
personnel, programs, and their areas of responsibility. 20.2. The Inspector General and Mission
The Inspector General (TIG). Serves as the functional and force management proponent for the
DAF IG system, and communicates directly with the SecAF, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief
of Space Operations, and all other USAF and USSF command elements on IG matters. TIG also
provides guidance and oversight to the Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) and the AFOSI. TIG
also serves on a number of panels, groups, and councils regarding USAF issues and programs. Mission. The IG mission is to independently assess and report on the discipline, readiness, economy, efficiency, and overall readiness of the DAF to the SecAF through specified inquiries, investigations, and inspections. Programs established to ensure this responsibility is achieved
include: AFIS; the Complaints Resolution Program; portions of the Insider Threat and
Antiterrorism Programs. 20.3. Inspector General Role
While IGs at all levels are the “eyes and ears” of the commander, their role is aligned to remove
perceived conflicts of interest, lack of independence, or apprehension by DAF personnel with
regard to the chain of command. The primary charge of the IG is to sustain a credible DAF IG
system by ensuring the existence of responsive complaint resolutions, including investigations, characterized by objectivity, integrity, and impartiality. The IG ensures the concerns of RegAF, Reserve, and Guard members; civilian employees, family members, and retirees; and the best
interests of the DAF, are addressed through objective fact-finding. Wing, Delta, and equivalent
IGs execute the commander’s inspection program, validate, and verify unit self-assessments, and
provide the commander an independent assessment of unit effectiveness. They inform the
commander of potential areas of concern as reflected by trends; function as the fact finder and
honest broker in the resolution of complaints; educate and train commanders and members of the
base population on their rights and responsibilities in regard to the DAF IG system; and help
commanders prevent, detect, and correct FWA and mismanagement. Airmen and Guardians at all
levels may report suspected systematic, programmatic, or procedural weaknesses, or seek further
assurance that resources are used effectively and efficiently by contacting the IG office. <!-- Page 378 -->

### Inspector General Selection
378
Eligible personnel are selected for a DAF IG assignment as functional experts with broad
contemporary experience from across the USAF. In addition to specific job requirement criteria
listed in DAFI 90-302, Airmen and Guardians selected for IG duties should possess attributes of
the highest professional standards and moral character, demonstrate potential for future service
and continued promotion, and provide credibility for those Airmen, Guardians, family members, and civilians who seek IG assistance. Additional qualifications include the ability to attain and
hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties required as an IG inspector, have no
record of civil conviction except for minor offenses, have neither conviction by court-martial, non-judicial punishment, or Unfavorable Information File in the official military personnel file, and present good military bearing and appearance. Note: Nuclear surety inspection inspectors
will have prior nuclear experience or experience applicable to current systems in the respective
MAJCOM prior to assignment as a nuclear inspector. 20.5. Air Force Inspection Scheduling Process (Gatekeepers)
The purpose of the Air Force Scheduling Process (Gatekeeper) is to synchronize inspection efforts
to maximize unit training days available and inspection resource usage, build out year schedules, and align non-AF inspection requirements. Gatekeepers ensure the inspection system is able to
inspect units independently and efficiently on behalf of the command chain and ensure a
commander’s priorities take precedence over non-mission essential activities of any unit or
organization. Gatekeepers have the authority to approve, disapprove, schedule, deconflict, and
eliminate duplication between all inspection-type activities on behalf of their commanders. 20.6. Inspection Types
Commander’s Inspection Program. A validated, accurate, and trusted CCIP is the cornerstone
of the Air Force Inspection System. An effective CCIP should provide the Wing commander, subordinate commanders, and Airmen and Guardians the right information at the right time to
appropriately assess risk, identify areas for improvement, determine root causes, and precisely
focus limited resources—all aligned with the Commander’s priorities on the Commander’s
timeline. The purpose of the CCIP is to improve readiness, efficiency, discipline, effectiveness, compliance, and surety at the Wing level. The intent of assessing these components is to provide
critical data to leadership about the adequacy of policy, training, manpower and personnel, funds, equipment, and facilities. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). Nuclear weapon systems and the units to which they are
assigned require special consideration because of political and military importance, destructive
power, and the potential consequences of a nuclear weapons incident or accident. MAJCOM IGs
execute nuclear inspections as a component of the Unit Effectiveness Inspection via performance
and compliance-based inspections to evaluate a unit’s ability to manage nuclear resources while
complying with all nuclear surety standards. The purpose of the NSI is to evaluate a
certified nuclear-capable unit’s ability to manage assigned nuclear resources and execute nuclear
missions in a safe, secure, and reliable manner. Unit Effectiveness Inspection (UEI). The UEI is a multi-year external continual evaluation of
Wing performance based on the four Major Graded Areas (MGA) conducted by MAJCOM IGs
and the DAFIA on wings and wing-equivalents. It is intended to help the wing commander
understand the areas of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance. The UEI evaluates the
CCIP for accuracy, adequacy, and relevance, while providing an independent assessment of the
Wing’s resource management, leadership, process improvement efforts, and the ability to execute
<!-- Page 379 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
379
the mission. The four MGAs are managing resources, leading people, improving the unit, and
executing the mission. 20.7. Unit Self-Assessment Program (USAP)
One of the primary objectives of the AFIS is to foster a culture of critical self-assessment and
continuous improvement and reduce reliance on external inspection teams. Similarly, the primary
purpose of the self-assessment program is to accurately identify and report issues to the command
chain in such a manner that makes Airmen feel they can safely report what’s true, not what they
believe their commander or IG expects them to report. An effective USAP depends on Airmen
and Guardians reporting the status of compliance with directives, and when they cannot comply, reporting what constraints prevent them from doing so. Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). MICT is a USAF program of record and is a
tool for managing USAPs. The USAP may include communication from self-assessment
communicators (SAC) within the MICT. Self-Assessment Communicator (SAC). SACs are a tool designed to improve compliance with
published guidance and communicate risk and program health up and down the chain of
command. As a self-assessment tool, SACs ask Airmen and Guardians at the shop-level to selfreport compliance or non- compliance. SACs may be tailored at the lowest Wing administrative
levels allowing units the flexibility to track on the most relevant questions. 20.8. Reporting Inspection Findings
IGs will ensure inspection reports document inspection activity findings, including safety, surety, or issues of military discipline. Upon completion of inspections, the IG will ensure inspection
reports include validated data categorized as strengths, deficiencies, or recommended
improvement areas. IGs at all levels should not duplicate deficiencies or observations which are
already entered into the Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS), MICT or
other self-assessment documentation or tracking methods by the inspected organization. <!-- Page 380 -->

## Section 20B — Individual Accountability

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**

Chapter 20—ENFORCING MILITARY STANDARDS SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
## Section 20B — Individual Accountability B B C C C

### Enforcing Standards
Enforcing military standards begins with individual accountability. There are some activities and
behaviors that, while arguably not illegal, are nevertheless inconsistent with maintaining good
order and discipline. Understanding the restrictions and our responsibilities for adhering to USAF
standards will help prevent the need to reinforce these standards. The Air Force Complaints Resolution Program. The Air Force Complaints Resolution Program
is a leadership tool that indicates where command involvement is needed to correct systematic, programmatic, or procedural weaknesses. Resolving the underlying cause of a complaint may
prevent more severe symptoms or costly consequences, such as reduced performance, accidents, poor quality work, or poor morale. The program also ensures the effective and efficient use of resources, resolves problems affecting
the Air Force mission promptly and objectively, creates an atmosphere of trust in which issues can
be objectively and fully resolved without retaliation or fear of reprisal, and assists commanders in
instilling confidence in Air Force leadership. Even though allegations may not be substantiated, the evidence or investigation findings may reveal systematic, morale, or other problems impeding
efficiency and mission effectiveness. Submitting Complaints. Under the Air Force Complaints Resolution Program, a member has the
right to present a complaint without fear of reprisal and is codified in Department of Defense and
Air Force guidance directives and instructions. Complaints may be submitted in person, by phone, through electronic means, or in writing to supervisors, first sergeants, commanders, members of
any level of the IG system, someone higher in the chain of command, or members of Congress. While members should attempt to resolve complaints at the lowest possible level before addressing
them to higher level command or the IG, public law states that no person may restrict a military
member from making a lawful communication to an IG or member of Congress. In addition to
having the right to present personal complaints, a member has the responsibility to report FWA, or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, instructions, or regulations; an
injustice; any abuse of authority; inappropriate conduct; or misconduct through appropriate
supervisory channels or the IG. Note: Only the IG may investigate allegations of reprisal and
restriction under the Military Whistleblower’s Protection Act. Complaints Addressed By Other Grievance or Appeal Channels. Matters normally addressed
through other established grievance or appeal channels may be referred back to the appropriate
grievance or appeal channel unless there is evidence these channels mishandled the matter or
process. Complainants must provide some relevant evidence that the process was mishandled or
handled prejudicially before an IG channel will process a complaint of mishandling. Dissatisfaction or disagreement with the outcome or findings of an alternative grievance or appeal
process is not a sufficient basis to warrant an IG investigation. For additional information on
procedures for filing an IG complaint and further details regarding the program, refer to DAFI
90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution. 20.10. Commander’s Authority and Responsibility
While preserving an Airman’s right of expression to the maximum extent possible, Air Force
commanders have the inherent authority and responsibility to take action to ensure the mission is
<!-- Page 381 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
381
performed. This authority and responsibility includes placing lawful restriction on engaging in
dissident and protest activities; writing, distributing, publishing, or posting any unauthorized
material; frequenting establishments that have been designated as ‘off limits’; participating in any
activities of illegal discrimination or any activities that a commander finds to be detrimental to
good order, discipline, or mission accomplishment; interfering with the USAF mission or law and
order; or presenting a clear danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of the U.S. Armed
Forces. 20.11. Public Statements
According to AFI 1-1, the issuance of public statements on official USAF matters is the
responsibility of cognizant unit or installation commanders and their public affairs representatives. Ensuring that official statements are properly worded and approved, avoids statements that do not
reflect official USAF policy or that could be misleading to the public if taken out of context. To
ensure USAF official information is presented professionally, personnel should make certain it is
accurate, prompt, and factual; is confined to their particular areas of expertise; avoids a
hypothetical and speculative nature; accurately reflects USAF policy; is presented simply and
honestly; and complies with the spirit and letter of the Secretary of Defense’s principles for public
information. For additional information, refer to AFI 35-101. As representatives of the service in both official and unofficial contact with the public, members
have many opportunities to contribute to positive public opinion toward the USAF. Each USAF
member is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance, starting with public
affairs, before releasing any proposed statement, text, or imagery to the public. This includes
digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website. Members must ensure the information
revealed, whether official or unofficial, is appropriate for release according to classification
requirements in DoDM5200.01V1_DAFMAN16-1404V1. 20.12. Free Exercise of Religion and Religious Accommodation
Every Airman has the right to individual expressions of sincerely held beliefs, to include
conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs, unless those expressions would have an adverse
impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health and safety, or mission
accomplishment. According to AFI 1-1, leaders at all levels must balance constitutional
protections for their own free exercise of religion, including individual expressions of religious
beliefs, and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion. They
must ensure their words and actions cannot reasonably be construed to be officially endorsing, disapproving, or extending preferential treatment for any faith, belief, or absence of belief. In
accordance with DAFI 52-201, Religious Freedom in the Department of the Air Force, Airmen
requesting religious accommodation must continue to comply with directives, instructions, and
lawful orders until the request is approved. If the request is not approved, the decision must be
based on the facts presented; must directly relate to the compelling government interest of military
readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health, safety, or mission accomplishment; and
must be by the least restrictive means necessary to avoid the adverse impact. 20.13. Political Activities
According to AFI 1-1, generally, as an individual, you enjoy the same rights and have the same
responsibilities as other citizens. However, as a member of the USAF, the manner in which you
exercise your rights is limited in some cases. While on RegAF status, members are prohibited from
engaging in certain political activities to maintain good order and discipline and to avoid conflicts
of interest and the appearance of improper endorsement in political matters. While USAF members
<!-- Page 382 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
382
do have the right and duty as American citizens to vote and voice opinions concerning political
matters, we must be careful that personal opinions and activities are not directly, or by implication, represented as those of the USAF. Prohibited Activities. USAF members may not participate in partisan political fundraising
activities, rallies, conventions (including making speeches in the course thereof), management of
campaigns, or debates, either on one’s own behalf or on that of another. This prohibition applies
whether the individual is in uniform or not, and regardless of whether an inference or appearance
of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement may be drawn. Participation includes more than
mere attendance as a spectator. USAF members are prohibited from wearing their uniform at a
political event, while making a public speech or interview, while walking picket lines, or
marching in a rally or other public demonstration. In addition, USAF members may not use
official authority or influence to interfere with an election, to affect its course or outcome, to
solicit votes for a particular candidate or issue, or to require or solicit political contributions from
others. Military personnel must not actively advocate supremacist, extremist, or criminal gang
doctrine, ideology, or causes, including those that advance, encourage, or advocate illegal
discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, religion, ethnicity, or national origin or those that
advance, encourage, or advocate the use of force, violence, or criminal activity or otherwise
advance efforts to deprive individuals of their civil rights. Before engaging in any political
activities, be sure to review applicable USAF instructions and guidance. DAFI 51-508 provides
detailed information on what USAF members may or may not be allowed to do regarding political
activities. DoD Directive 1344.10, Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces, includes
guidance on political activities for all U.S. Armed Forces. Also reference DoDI 1325.06, Handling Protest, Extremist, and Criminal Gang Activities Among Members of the Armed Forces
and DAFI 52-201, Religious Freedom in the Department of the Air Force. Note: Military
members who engage in specific prohibited activities listed in DoDD 1344.10 and DAFI 51-508
are subject to prosecution under Article 92, UCMJ, in addition to any other applicable provision
of the UCMJ or Federal law. Military Criminal Investigative Organizations, Security Police, military commanders, and other
military organizations and officials must report all allegations to Wing, Delta, or servicing IG
office no later than 30 calendar days after receiving an allegation that an Airman or Guardian
engaged in an activity prohibited under DoDI 1325.06. For Reserve Component officials, transmission is required not later than 60 calendar days. 20.14. Alcohol Abuse
USAF policy recognizes that alcohol abuse negatively affects public behavior, duty performance, and physical and mental health. The USAF provides comprehensive clinical assistance to eligible
beneficiaries seeking help for an alcohol problem. According to AFI 1-1, USAF policy is to
prevent alcohol abuse and alcoholism among its personnel and dependents; to assist USAF
personnel in resolving alcohol-related problems; and to ensure humane management and
administrative disposition of those who are unable or unwilling to be restored to full, effective
functioning. All Airmen are responsible for exercising good judgment in the use of alcohol. State
and foreign country drinking age laws, including those in a deployed environment, must be obeyed
both on- and off-duty. Use of alcohol must not adversely affect duty performance or conduct onor off-duty, to include the ability to be recalled, if specifically required, (when serving in an oncall status) during scheduled off-duty time. Also reference DAFI 34-107, Alcoholic Beverage
Program. Drunk Driving. Drunk driving can lead to disciplinary action, including criminal prosecution
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and local and state criminal laws. AFI 31-
<!-- Page 383 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
383
218, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, applies to everyone with military installation driving
privileges. A person with a blood alcohol concentration greater than.08 is considered impaired, even without any other evidence. If a member has a blood alcohol percentage of 0.05 but less than
0.08, the person may be presumed to be impaired. This standard may be considered with other
competent evidence in determining whether the person is under the influence of alcohol. There is
a one-year driving privilege suspension for driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle
while under the influence of intoxicating liquor at a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent
or greater. 20.15. Substance Use/Misuse
Department of Defense policy is to prevent and eliminate problematic substance use in the
Department of Defense. Substance use and abuse is incompatible with USAF core values, maintenance of high standards of behavior, performance, readiness, and the discipline necessary
to accomplish the Air Force mission. Additionally, substance abuse and misuse can cause serious
physical and mental health problems and jeopardize safety. According to AFI 1-1, the illegal use of drugs, or improper use of legal drugs, is prohibited and
will not be tolerated. In DAFMAN 44-197, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program, drug
abuse is described as the wrongful use, possession, distribution, or introduction onto a military
installation or other property or facility under military supervision, of a controlled substance, prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, or intoxicating substance (other than
alcohol). “Wrongful” means without legal justification or excuse, and includes use contrary to the
directions of the manufacturer or prescribing healthcare provider, and use of any intoxicating
substance not intended for human ingestion. Drug abuse also includes inhalant abuse (sometimes
referred to as huffing) and steroid use, other than that specifically prescribed by a competent
medical authority. Violators are subject to punitive action under the UCMJ as well as adverse
administrative actions, up to and including administrative separation. The knowing use of any
intoxicating substance (other than the lawful use of alcohol, tobacco products, or prescription
drugs), which is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter
mood or function, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. The possession of an intoxicating
substance with the intent to use in a manner that would alter mood or function, without legal
authorization, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. Failure by military personnel to comply with
these prohibitions may result in prosecution under the UCMJ or state and local laws, as well as
adverse administrative actions up to and including administrative separation. Note: USAF
members with substance abuse problems are encouraged to seek assistance from the unit
commander, first sergeant, substance abuse counselor, or a military medical professional through
the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program. ADAPT and drug
demand reduction programs include substance use/misuse prevention, education, treatment, and
urinalysis testing. Members are held to the highest standards of discipline and behavior, both onand off-duty. All patients diagnosed with a substance use disorder and entered into ADAPT will
be recommended for limited duty, indicating the patient is not worldwide qualified. Individuals
who experience problems related to substance use/misuse will receive counseling and treatment as
needed; however, all USAF members are held accountable for unacceptable behavior. Commander’s Identification. Unit commanders will refer all service members for assessment
when substance use or misuse is suspected to be a contributing factor in any misconduct. Examples
include driving under the influence, public intoxication, drunk and disorderly conduct, spouse or
child abuse and maltreatment, underage drinking, positive drug test, or when notified by medical
personnel. Commanders who fail to comply with this requirement place the member at increased
risk for developing severe substance problems and may jeopardize the safety of others and
<!-- Page 384 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
ultimately mission accomplishment. 20.16. Drug Testing
384
The USAF conducts drug testing of personnel according to DAFMAN 44-197. Drug testing is an
effective deterrent for the illegal use of drugs; therefore, USAF military members are subject to
testing regardless of grade, status, or position. Military members may receive an order or may
voluntarily consent to provide urine samples at any time. Military members who fail to comply
with an order to provide a urine sample are subject to punitive action under the UCMJ. Note: Commander-directed testing should only be used as a last resort because the results may not be
used for disciplinary action under the UCMJ or to characterize an administrative discharge. Inspection under Military Rule of Evidence 313. In general, an inspection is an examination
conducted as an incident of command, the primary purpose of which is to determine and ensure
the security, military fitness, or good order and discipline of a unit, organization, or installation. Inspections may utilize any reasonable natural or technological aid and may be conducted with or
without notice to those inspected. The positive result of a urine sample may be used to refer a
member for a substance use evaluation, as evidence to support disciplinary action under the UCMJ
or administrative discharge action, and as a consideration on the issue of characterization of
discharge in administrative discharges. Probable Cause Search under Military Rule of Evidence 315. A probable cause search requires
a search and seizure authorization from the appropriate commander, military judge, military
magistrate, or other competent search authority in order to seize a urine specimen. Probable cause
exists when there is a reasonable belief that evidence of illegal drug use will be found in the
system of the member to be tested. Results may be used as evidence to support disciplinary action
under the UCMJ, or in an administrative discharge action. Medical Purposes. Results of any examination conducted for a valid medical purpose, including
emergency medical treatment, periodic physical examination, and other such examinations
necessary for diagnostic or treatment purposes, may be used to identify drug abusers. Results may
be used as evidence to support disciplinary action under the UCMJ or in administrative discharge
action. Self-identification. USAF members (not currently under investigation or pending action), with
alcohol problems, substance use problems, or personal drug use or possession, are encouraged to
seek assistance from the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a military
medical professional. Following an assessment, the ADAPT program manager will consult with
the treatment team and determine an appropriate clinical course of action. Commanders may not
use voluntary self-identification of a substance use problem against a member in an action under
the UCMJ or when determining the appropriate characterization of service in an administrative
discharge action. <!-- Page 385 -->

## Section 20C — Appropriate Working Relationships B B C C C

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**
Chapter 20—ENFORCING MILITARY STANDARDS SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
### Working Relationships
Social interaction that contributes appropriately to unit cohesiveness and effectiveness is
encouraged. Military members of all grades must maintain professional relationships with civilian
employees and government contractor personnel they work with, supervise, or direct, and must
avoid relationships that adversely affect or are perceived to adversely affect morale, discipline, respect for authority, and unit cohesion, or that violate law or regulation. While personal
relationships between USAF members are normally matters of individual choice and judgment, they become matters of official concern when they adversely affect or have the reasonable potential
to affect the USAF by eroding morale, good order, discipline, respect for authority, unit cohesion, or mission accomplishment. Professional Relationships. As stated in AFI 1-1, appropriate professional relationships are vital
to the effective operation of all organizations and to maintaining good order and discipline. The
nature of the military mission requires absolute confidence in command and an unhesitating
adherence to orders that may result in inconvenience, hardships, and at times, injury, or death. This
distinction makes the maintenance of professional relationships in the military more critical than
in civilian organizations. AFI 36-2909, Air Force Professional Relationships and Conduct, establishes responsibilities for maintaining professional relationships. Unprofessional Relationships. Unprofessional relationships, whether pursued on- or off-duty, are
those relationships that detract from the authority of superiors, or result in, or reasonably create
the appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of organizational
goals for personal interests. Once established, unprofessional relationships, such as inappropriate
personal relationships and favoritism, do not go unnoticed by other members of a unit, and call
into question the superior’s impartiality toward the subordinate and his or her peers. Unprofessional relationships must be avoided between officers, between enlisted members, between officers and enlisted members, between military personnel and civilian employees or
contractor personnel, as well as within and across the military branches. Relationships in which
one member exercises supervisory or command authority over another have the potential for
becoming unprofessional. Similarly, differences in grade increase the risk that a relationship will
be, or will be perceived to be, unprofessional because senior members in military organizations
have direct or indirect organizational influence over the duties and careers of junior members. The
ability of the senior member to directly or indirectly influence assignments, promotion
recommendations, duties, awards, and other privileges and benefits, places both the senior member
and the junior member in susceptible situations. Fraternization. Fraternization is an unprofessional relationship between an officer and enlisted
member specifically prohibited by Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice. Fraternization
exists when a relationship between an officer and an enlisted member puts the enlisted member on
terms of military equality with the officer in a way that prejudices good order and discipline in the
U.S. Armed Forces or brings discredit upon the U.S. Armed Forces. This custom of the service recognizes that officers will not form personal relationships with
enlisted members on terms of military equality, whether on- or off-duty. Whether a contact or
association constitutes fraternization depends on the surrounding circumstances, such as whether
<!-- Page 386 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
386
the conduct has compromised the chain of command; has resulted in the appearance of partiality; or has otherwise undermined good order, discipline, authority, or morale. The prohibition on
fraternization extends beyond organizational and chain of command lines to include members
among or across different services. In short, it extends to all officer and enlisted relationships. When fraternization occurs, the officer will be held primarily responsible, and is the only member
subject to disciplinary action for fraternization under Article 134, UCMJ; however, an enlisted
member involved in consensual fraternization is still engaged in an unprofessional relationship
and is likewise subject to discipline under Article 92, UCMJ. 20.18. Equal Opportunity
The USAF Equal Opportunity Program fosters and supports equal opportunity and must be carried
out in the day-to-day actions of all personnel. The USAF will not tolerate unlawful discrimination, harassment, or reprisal against individuals who engage in protected activity. Airmen must actively
make workplace professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent and eliminate
unlawful discriminatory or harassment behavior. Commanders and supervisors are charged with
taking immediate and appropriate actions to address inappropriate behaviors or allegations once
they are made aware and are encouraged to consult with their local equal opportunity office before
initiating action to resolve such concerns. Refer to AFI 36-2710, Equal Opportunity Program, for
additional information. Note: The Air Force Sexual Harassment/Unlawful Discrimination (24hour) Hotline (1-888-231-4058), is established to ensure USAF personnel can easily and freely
report to proper Equal Opportunity authorities any allegations of sexual harassment or
discrimination and provide information on sexual harassment and equal opportunity issues. Equal Opportunity Program Objectives. The primary objective of the Equal Opportunity
Program is to eradicate unlawful discrimination and foster a positive human relations environment. To this end, Equal Opportunity offices at every installation stand ready to assist individuals, supervisors, and commanders with eradicating every form of unlawful discrimination and
harassment from the workplace. To improve the USAF human relations environment, Equal
Opportunity offices offer an array of counseling, mediation, education, assessment, training, general assistance, and complaint resolution services. Unlawful Discrimination. Unlawful discrimination can include the use of disparaging terms
regarding an individual’s birthplace, ancestry, culture, or the linguistic characteristics common to
a specific ethnic group. The use of terms that degrade or connote negative statements pertaining
to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and mental or physical
disability, can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms include insults, printed material, visual material, signs, symbols, posters, or insignia. Unlawful Discrimination Against Military Members. Unlawful discrimination against
military members includes any unlawful action that denies equal opportunities to persons or
groups based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex. This type of discrimination
includes verbal, physical, and non-verbal forms, as well as social media. For military members, unlawful discrimination is unacceptable, on- or off-base, 24 hours a day. Unlawful Discrimination Against Department of Defense Civilian Employees. Unlawful
discrimination against civilian employees includes any unlawful employment practice that
occurs when an employer fails or refuses to hire or promote; discharges or otherwise
discriminates against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment; limits, segregates, or classifies employees or applicants for
employment in a way that deprives or tends to deprive any individual of employment
opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his/her status as an employee because of race, <!-- Page 387 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
387
color, religion, national origin, sex, age (40 or older), genetic information, physical or mental
disability, or reprisal). 20.19. Harassment
Harassment against military members or civilian employees includes any behavior that is
unwelcome or offensive to a reasonable person, whether oral, written, or physical, that creates an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Harassment includes use of electronic
communications, social media, other forms of communication, and in person. Harassment may
include offensive jokes, epithets, ridicule or mockery, insults, or put-downs, displays of offensive
objects or imagery, stereotyping, intimidating acts, veiled threats of violence, threatening or
provoking remarks, racial or other slurs, derogatory remarks about a person’s accent, or displays
of racially offensive symbols. Activities or actions undertaken for a proper military or
governmental purpose, such as combat survival training, are not considered harassment. Six Distinct Forms of Harassment. The Air Force Equal Opportunity Program covers six distinct
forms of harassment: discriminatory, sexual, bullying, hazing, retaliation, and reprisal. They are
briefly described here. Discriminatory Harassment. Discriminatory harassment is conduct that is unwelcome based
on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment is conduct that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and deliberate or repeated offensive comments or gestures of a
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is, either explicitly or implicitly, made a
term or condition of a person’s job, pay, or career, (2) submission to or rejection of such
conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or employment decisions affecting that person; or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s
work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment and is
so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive the environment as hostile or
offensive. Any use or condonation, by any person in a supervisory or command position, of any form of
sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of a member of the Armed
Forces or a DoD civilian employee. Any deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comments
or gestures of a sexual nature by any member of the Armed Forces or a DoD civilian employee. There is no requirement for concrete psychological harm to the complainant for behavior to
constitute sexual harassment. Behavior is sufficient to constitute sexual harassment if it is so
severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive, and the complainant does
perceive, the environment as hostile or offensive. Sexual harassment can occur through
electronic communications, including social media, other forms of communication, and in
person. To demonstrate the severity of sexual harassment violations in the military, in January 2022, President Joseph Biden signed an executive order that establishes sexual harassment as a
specific crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For purposes of conducting criminal investigations of formal complaints of sexual harassment
pursuant to the procedures in 10 USC § 1561, sexual harassment is defined as conduct that
constitutes the offense of sexual harassment as punishable under Article 134, UCMJ. Bullying. A form of harassment that includes acts of aggression by a military member or civilian
<!-- Page 388 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
388
employee with a nexus to military service, with the intent of harming a service member either
physically or psychologically, without a proper military or other governmental purpose. Bullying may involve the singling out of an individual from his or her coworkers, or unit, for
ridicule because he or she is considered different or weak. It often involves an imbalance of
power between the aggressor and the victim. Bullying can be conducted through electronic
devices or communications, and by other means including social media, as well as in person. Service members may be responsible for an act of bullying even if there was actual or implied
consent from the victim and regardless of the grade or rank, status, or service of the victim. Bullying is prohibited in all circumstances and environments, including off-duty or “unofficial”
unit functions and settings. Note: Bullying does not include properly directed command or
organizational activities that serve a proper military or other governmental purpose, or the
requisite training activities required to prepare for these activities, such as commandauthorized physical training. Hazing. A form of harassment that includes conduct through which military members or
civilian employees, without a proper military or other governmental purpose but with a nexus
to military service, physically or psychologically injure or create a risk of physical or
psychological injury to service members for the purpose of: initiation into, admission into, affiliation with, change in status or position within, or a condition for continued membership in
any military or Department of Defense civilian organization. Hazing can be conducted through
the use of electronic devices or communications, and by other means including social media, as well as in person. Service members may be responsible for an act of hazing even if there was
actual or implied consent from the victim and regardless of the grade or rank, status, or service
of the victim. Hazing is prohibited in all circumstances and environments including off-duty or
“unofficial” unit functions and settings. Note: Hazing does not include properly directed
command or organizational activities that serve a proper military or other governmental
purpose, or the requisite training activities required to prepare for these activities, such as, administrative corrective measures, extra military instruction, or command-authorized
physical training. Retaliation. Retaliation is taking or threatening to take an adverse personnel action against a
person, or wrongfully withholding or threatening to withhold a favorable personnel action with
respect to a person, as a result of that person reporting a criminal offense or making a protected
communication or planning to do either. A protected communication is a communication made
to a Member of Congress or an Inspector General, or to certain other authorities when the
communication discloses evidence of a violation of law or regulation, including sexual
harassment and unlawful discrimination. A protected communication may also relate to gross
mismanagement, fraud, waste, and abuse or a substantial danger to public health and safety. Retaliation is prohibited by Article 132, UCMJ. 20.20. Military Equal Opportunity Complaint Process
Only military personnel, their family members, and retirees may file military Equal Opportunity
complaints. To file a complaint, the individual must be the subject of the alleged unlawful
discrimination or sexual harassment. Third parties, to include commanders, supervisors, or coworkers, may not file a complaint on behalf of another individual. The Equal Opportunity office
will refer all third party individuals who are aware of specific allegations of military Equal
Opportunity policy violations to their respective chain of command. The Equal Opportunity office
will not accept military complaints from military members, family members, or retirees if the
concerns are related to off-base or Department of Defense civilian employment. Military Informal Complaint Procedures. The purpose of the military informal complaint
<!-- Page 389 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
389
process is to attempt resolution at the lowest possible level. To informally resolve unlawful
discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, individuals may orally address or prepare
written correspondence to the alleged offender, request intervention by a coworker, opt to use the
alternate dispute resolution process, or use the chain of command, such as requesting assistance
from the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander. There is no time limit for filing informal
complaints and no requirement for commander approval before accepting informal complaints. Military Formal Complaint Procedures. The purpose of the military formal complaint process
is to enable military members, retirees, and their family members to formally present allegations
of unlawful discrimination to the Equal Opportunity office with the goal of attempting resolution
through a complaint clarification process. The complaint clarification process involves gathering
information regarding a formal military complaint or hotline complaint to determine whether a
‘preponderance of evidence’ exists to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination occurred. The
complaint clarification includes interviewing or taking statements from complainants, potential
witnesses, alleged offenders, and anyone else who may have information relevant to the case. The
Equal Opportunity office may use information gathered from other investigations in conjunction
with, but not in lieu of, their own clarification process to establish a preponderance of credible
evidence. The clarification results are forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate for a legal sufficiency
review. Once the review is complete, the alleged offender’s commander receives the complaint for
final action, if appropriate. Military formal complaints must be filed within 60 calendar days of the
alleged offense. The installation commander may waive the time limits for good cause based on a
memorandum with sufficient justification provided by the complainant and submitted through the
Equal Opportunity office. Formal complaints of sexual harassment are referred to security forces
(SF) for an independent investigation pursuant to the procedures in 10 United States Code (USC)
§ 1561. 20.21. Civilian Equal Opportunity Complaint Process
Only USAF employees, former employees, and applicants for employment may file civilian Equal
Opportunity complaints. An aggrieved person can file a complaint if discriminated against on the
basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age (40 and older), or disability, or if subjected
to sexual harassment or retaliated against for opposing discrimination or for participating in the
complaint process. Additionally, an employee can file a complaint under Title II of the Public
Law 110-233, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which prohibits genetic
information discrimination for any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job
assignment, promotion, layoff, training, fringe benefits, or any other term or condition of
employment. To harass or retaliate against a person because of his or her genetic information is
illegal under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Civilian Informal Complaint Procedures. The purpose of the civilian informal complaint
process is to provide for the prompt, fair, and impartial processing, and resolution of complaints, consistent with legal obligations under Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614, Federal
Sector Equal Employment Opportunity. The objective is to seek opportunities to resolve issues at
the lowest organizational level at the earliest possible time. The Equal Opportunity office will
work with management and the Staff Judge Advocate in an attempt to resolve the complainant’s
concerns. The Equal Opportunity office must complete the informal complaint process within 30
calendar days of the complaint being filed unless the complainant grants an extension not to
exceed 60 additional calendar days. If the matter is not resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction
before the end of the authorized period, including extensions, the complainant is issued a notice
of right to file a formal complaint. Civilian Formal Complaint Procedures. A formal complaint must be filed at the installation
<!-- Page 390 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
390
where the alleged discrimination occurred. For the complaint to be processed at the formal stage, the initial contact must be within 45 calendar days of the date of the matter alleged to be
discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date
or when he or she becomes aware of the personnel action. The complaint must describe the actions
or practices that form the basis of the complaint that was discussed with the Equal Opportunity
office during the informal complaint process. The complaint must be filed with the Equal
Opportunity director or designee within 15 calendar days of the complainant receiving the notice
of right to file a formal complaint. The USAF is required to process civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaints in accordance with
Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614, Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity
Management Directive 110. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires federal
agencies to discharge certain responsibilities once a civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaint
is filed. The Equal Opportunity office must process all formal complaints expeditiously and make
a determination whether to accept, dismiss, or partially dismiss a complaint or portion of a
complaint to allow an investigation to be completed within 180 calendar days from the date filed. 20.22. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response
The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Office is responsible for oversight of the
Department of Defense sexual assault policy and works hand-in-hand with the services and the
civilian community to develop and implement innovative prevention and response programs. Refer
to AFI 90-6006, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program, for details regarding
the USAF SAPR program. Installation Sexual Assault Response Coordinator. The installation Sexual Assault Response
Coordinator (SARC) is the single point of contact at an installation or within a geographic area
reporting to the installation commander, who oversees sexual assault awareness, prevention, and
response training; coordinates medical treatment, including emergency care for sexual assault
victims; and tracks the services provided to a victim of sexual assault from the initial report through
final disposition and resolution. Note: The USAF will identify trained military SARCs, as well as
trained civilian SARCs or SAPR Victim Advocates (SAPR VA), for rotational support of global
contingency operations and deployments. Normally, each air expeditionary wing will warrant at
least one SARC and one SAPR VA position. For deployments smaller than an air expeditionary
force, deployed commanders must provide a sexual assault response capability consistent with
USAF requirements. Victims’ Counsel. The Victims’ Counsel (VC) is a military attorney who is authorized to provide
independent legal representation to eligible victims of sexual assault, sexual misconduct, stalking, and other similar crimes. A VC’s primary responsibility is to their client. The VC has 3 main roles: (1) Advocate - to provide victims zealous advocacy by protecting their rights; (2) Advise - to
provide legal advice by developing victims’ understanding of the often complex investigatory and
military justice system; (3) Empower - by removing barriers to their full participation in the
military justice process. Sexual Assault. Sexual assault is criminal conduct that violates the standards the United States of
America expects of the men and women serving in the USAF and is inconsistent with our core
values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. Inherent in these core
values is respect: self-respect, mutual respect, and respect for the USAF as an institution. Sexual
assault is an intentional sexual contact, characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. The term sexual assault
encompasses a range of sexual offenses specifically prohibited by Articles 120, 120b, and 80 of
<!-- Page 391 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
391
the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to include rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy, or attempts to commit any of these offenses. Consent. Consent is defined as words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the
sexual conduct by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct
means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the
accused’s use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear, does not constitute
consent. A current or previous relationship, or the manner of dress of the person involved with the
accused in the sexual conduct at issue, shall not constitute consent. There is no consent where the
person is sleeping or incapacitated, such as due to age, alcohol or drugs, or mental incapacity. Response to an Allegation of Sexual Assault. Any military member or civilian employee, other
than those authorized to receive confidential communications or otherwise exempted by law, regulation, or policy, who receives a report of a sexual assault incident about a subordinate in the
individual’s supervisory chain, will report the matter to the commander, the SARC, and the Air
Force Office of Special Investigations. Military members or civilian employees who become aware
of a sexual assault incident, not involving a subordinate in the supervisory chain, are strongly
encouraged, but not required, to report the incident to the SARC or encourage the victim to do so. 20.23. Sexual Assault Reporting Options
The USAF has two reporting options: unrestricted and restricted reporting. The USAF makes every
effort to treat victims of sexual assault with dignity and respect, to protect their privacy to the
maximum extent of the law, and provide support, advocacy, and care. Regardless of whether the
victim elects restricted or unrestricted reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be
maintained. Restricted Reports. The Department of Defense has directed the implementation of
confidentiality in the form of a restricted reporting option that enables eligible victims to report
allegations of sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an investigation. This
reporting option is intended to remove barriers to medical care and support while giving the victim
additional time and increased control over the release and management of personal information. Only SARCs, SAPR VAs, VVAs, and healthcare personnel may receive restricted reports of
sexual assault. If a victim elects this reporting option, a victim may convert a restricted report to
an unrestricted report at any time. Chaplains, legal assistance attorneys, and VC entitled to
privileged communications will not accept a restricted report of sexual assault. However, in the
course of otherwise privileged communications with chaplains, legal assistance attorneys, and VC, a victim may indicate that he or she wishes to file a restricted report. If this occurs, the chaplains, legal assistance attorneys, and VC will facilitate contact with a SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA to
ensure that a victim is offered SAPR services. Unrestricted Reports. Any report of a sexual assault made by the victim through normal reporting
channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement, and the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations or other criminal investigative services, is considered an unrestricted report. If a victim elects this reporting option, a victim will not be permitted to change from unrestricted
to a restricted report. The individual to whom an unrestricted report is made will notify the SARC. Any report of sexual assault made through the SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, or healthcare personnel
by an individual who elects an unrestricted report and designates so in writing, will be forwarded
to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Victims may elect to make a restricted report of
sexual assault at all times, except in cases where the victim personally reported the incident to
law enforcement (including MCIOs) or previously filed an Unrestricted Report with a signed DD
Form 2910 for the same incident. Victims can file a Restricted Report even if the allegation has
<!-- Page 392 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
392
been inadvertently or previously disclosed to command by the victim, suspect, or third party; or
he matter has been reported to law enforcement, to include MCIOs, by anyone other than the
victim; or an investigation is initiated, in progress, or closed. In cases of an unrestricted report of a sexual assault or information concerning a sexual assault, information concerning the victim and the offense will only be provided to governmental entities
or persons with an established official need to know. Those who are deemed to have an official
need to know in the USAF to perform their respective duties, routinely include: law enforcement, commanders, and first sergeants of the victim and the alleged assailant, legal personnel, the SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, and healthcare providers, as required. Commanders notified of a sexual assault through an unrestricted report must take immediate steps
to ensure the victim’s physical safety, emotional security, and medical treatment needs are met
and that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or appropriate criminal investigative agency
and SARC are notified. Reporting Eligibility. The following individuals are eligible for both the restricted and
unrestricted reporting option within the SARC program. RegAF members who were sexual assault victims perpetrated by someone other than the
victim’s spouse. Military members, who are on RegAF status, but who were sexual assault victims prior to
enlistment or commissioning, are eligible to receive SAPR services under either reporting
option. Support to a member on RegAF status is available regardless of when or where the
sexual assault took place. Service members’ dependents, 18 years of age and older, who are eligible for treatment in the
military health system at installations in the Continental United States and outside of the
Continental United States, and who were sexual assault victims perpetrated by someone other
than the victim’s spouse. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members who are sexually assaulted when
performing active service and inactive duty training. Department of Defense civilian employees will have access to full SAPR services that are
offered to service members. This does not include additional medical entitlements or legal
services to which they are not already authorized by law or policy. Collateral Misconduct in Sexual Assault Cases. An investigation into the facts and
circumstances surrounding an alleged sexual assault may produce evidence that the victim engaged
in misconduct. Collateral misconduct by a sexual assault victim is a significant barrier to reporting
because of the victim’s fear of punishment. Some reported sexual assaults involve circumstances
where the victim may have engaged in some form of misconduct like underage drinking or other
related alcohol offenses, adultery, drug abuse, fraternization, or other violations of instructions or
orders. In accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Manual for Courts-Martial, and
USAF instructions, commanders are responsible for addressing misconduct in a manner that is
consistent and appropriate to the circumstances. However, Rule for Courts-Martial 306 permits
superior commanders to withhold disciplinary authority from subordinate commanders for
individual cases, types of cases, or generally. Pursuant to DAFI 51-201, Administration of Military
Justice, the authority to dispose of collateral misconduct in sexual assault cases is initially
reserved to the special court-martial convening authority. In those cases, the subordinate
commander forwards the case file, along with a written recommendation, to the initial disposition
<!-- Page 393 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
393
authority. The initial disposition authority may dispose of the collateral misconduct himself or
herself or may return the case file to the subordinate commander and permit him or her to take
action. Safe-to-Report Policy. The Safe-to-Report Policy is applicable to any allegation of sexual
assault, regardless of whether the victim has filed a restricted or unrestricted report. The threshold
issue for the applicability of the Safe-to-Report Policy is determining whether the alleged
collateral misconduct in question is “minor” or “non-minor.” The authority to make such a
determination is withheld to the Initial Disposition Authority (IDA), as outlined in DAFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, paragraph 10.5.1. The IDA’s determination is discretionary
based on the totality of the circumstances involved in the case, but the IDA must assess the alleged
collateral misconduct against the delineated aggravating and mitigating circumstances at a
minimum. If the alleged collateral misconduct is deemed minor, then the Safe-to-Report Policy
applies and the victim will not be disciplined. If the alleged collateral misconduct is non-minor, then the Safe-to-Report Policy does NOT apply, and the victim could be subject to disciplinary
action. <!-- Page 394 -->

### Corrective Actions
Commanders, supervisors, and other persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands that are intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who
depart from standards of performance, conduct, bearing, and integrity, on- or off-duty, and whose
actions degrade the individual and the unit mission. Personnel Information File. Commanders and supervisors perform many personnel management
functions requiring them to keep Personnel Information Files (PIF) on assigned personnel. DAFI
36-2608, Military Personnel Records System, authorizes the use and maintenance of PIFs by
commanders and supervisors. If a PIF is established, use of AF Form 10A, Personnel Information
File, Record of Performance; Officer Command Selection Record Group (Folder), is required. Custodians must keep PIFs current and secured in a locked area or container to protect against
misuse or unauthorized access. The member may gain access to their PIF at any time per AFI 33332. Contents of the PIF must be available to commanders, raters, first sergeants, senior raters, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and Staff Judge Advocate personnel, as warranted. The release and review of the PIF contents in these instances are for official business or routine
use. Unfavorable Information File. The Unfavorable Information File (UIF) provides commanders
with an official and single means of filing derogatory data concerning a USAF member’s personal
conduct and duty performance. With some exceptions, the commander has wide discretion as to
what should be placed in a UIF and what should be removed. Mandatory documents in UIFs
include suspended or unsuspended Article 15 punishment of more than one month (31 days or
more), court-martial conviction, civilian conviction where the penalty or actions equivalent to a
finding of guilty of an offense which resulted in confinement of one year or more or could have
resulted in a penalty of confinement for more than one year or death, and control roster actions. Optional documents may be included in UIFs for up to one year. Individuals have three duty days
to acknowledge and provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision. The commander advises the individual of the final decision. If the commander decides to file the
information in a UIF, the individual’s response is also filed. Unit commanders must review all UIFs within 90 days of assuming or being appointed to
command; when individuals are considered for promotion, reenlistment, permanent change of
station or assignment, and reclassification or retraining. Commanders also review UIFs annually, with the assistance of the Staff Judge Advocate. Commanders keep the UIF for the disposition
period unless early removal is clearly warranted. In the course of their USAF duties, the following
individuals are authorized access to a member’s UIF: the member, commander, first sergeant, enlisted performance report reporting and rating officials, force support squadron personnel, inspector general, inspection team, legal office personnel, military equal opportunity personnel, law enforcement personnel, and substance abuse counselors. For additional information regarding
the UIF program, refer to DAFI 36-2907, Adverse Administrative Actions. Control Roster. Control rosters are used by commanders to establish an observation period as a
rehabilitative tool for individuals whose duty performance is substandard or who fail to meet or
maintain USAF standards of conduct, bearing, and integrity, on- or off-duty. Commanders should
consider prior incidents, acts, failures, counseling, and rehabilitative efforts when establishing
<!-- Page 395 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
395
control rosters. A single incident of substandard performance or an isolated breach of standards
not likely to be repeated, is not ordinarily a basis for a control roster action. Commanders place
an individual on the control roster by using DAF Form 1058, Unfavorable Information File
Action, which puts the member on notice that his/her performance and behavior must improve, or
he/she will face more severe administrative action or punishment. The individual acknowledges
receipt of the action and has three duty days to respond and submit a statement on his or her behalf
before the action is finalized. Placement on the control roster is a mandatory UIF entry and is
initially instated for six months, but it can be removed early at the commander’s discretion. If a
member is not rehabilitated within six months of being placed on the control roster, the
commander initiates more severe action. The UIF six-month time period begins the day the DAF
Form 1058 is finalized and ends at 2400 hours six months later. Note: The control roster is not to
be used by commanders as a substitute for more appropriate administrative, judicial, or
nonjudicial action. 20.25. Administrative Counseling, Admonitions, and Reprimands
Administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are quality force management tools
available to supervisors, commanders, and other persons in authority to help maintain established
USAF standards and enhance mission accomplishment. These tools are intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from standards of performance, conduct, bearing, and integrity on- or off-duty, and whose actions degrade the individual and unit’s mission. Counseling, admonitions, and reprimands should be used as part of a graduated pattern of
discipline in response to repeated departures from standards. The decision to issue a letter of
counseling, admonition, or reprimand should be based primarily on the nature and seriousness of
the incident and on the previous disciplinary record of the member. Counseling statements may be either verbal or written, but written corrective actions are more
meaningful to the member, and when documented properly, may be used in subsequent
proceedings. Written administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the
rules of access, protection, and disclosure outlined in the Privacy Act of 1974. The same rules
apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and those filed in a UIF or PIF. Preponderance of the evidence is the standard to utilize in administrative action proceedings when
evaluating whether the evidence establishes that misconduct occurred. A preponderance of the
evidence simply means the greater weight of credible evidence. If such proof is lacking, administrative action is susceptible to being found to be legally unsupportable and, as a result, could be set aside. Letter of Counseling and Department of the Air Force Form 174, Record of Individual
Counseling. Counseling is used by first line supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders to help
Airmen use good judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve problems. Counseling, whether conducted verbally or in writing, helps subordinates develop skills, attitudes, and
behaviors consistent with maintaining USAF readiness. Counseling may be documented on an
DAF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling, or on bond paper or letterhead as a letter of
counseling. Letter of Admonishment. An admonishment is used to document an infraction that warrants more
severe action than a counseling, but not serious enough to warrant a reprimand. For officer
personnel, if the letter of admonishment is not filed in the UIF, it must be filed in the individual's
PIF. Letter of Reprimand. A reprimand is more severe than a letter of counseling and letter of
admonishment and indicates a stronger degree of official censure. Commanders may elect to file
<!-- Page 396 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
396
a letter of reprimand in a UIF for enlisted personnel. Letters of reprimand are mandatory for file
in the UIF for officer personnel. 20.26. Administrative Demotion of Airmen
Administrative demotion of an Airman is a tool available for commanders for certain reasons. Administrative demotions should not replace action under the UCMJ. There are a number of
reasons to demote, such as failing to fulfill Airmen/NCO/SNCO responsibilities, failure to keep
fit, and student status termination. When appropriate, Airmen should be given an opportunity to
overcome their deficiencies before demotion action is initiated. The administrative demotion
process is captured in AFI 36-2502. 20.27. Administrative Separations
Airmen are entitled to separate at their expiration of term of service unless there is a specific
authority for retention. As a rule, Airmen separate on the date their expiration of term of service
occurs, but their separation is not automatic. Airmen are members of the USAF until they are
separated by administrative action. Many different reasons for separation exist. The suitability of
persons to serve in the USAF is judged on the basis of their conduct and their ability to meet
required standards of duty performance and discipline. Commanders and supervisors must identify
enlisted members who show a likelihood for early separation and make reasonable efforts to help
these members meet USAF standards. Members who do not show potential for further service
should be discharged. Commanders must consult the servicing Staff Judge Advocate and military
personnel flight before initiating the involuntary separation of a member. Required Separation. Airmen who will continue to serve in another military status must separate; for example, an Airman may separate to serve with the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard. An Airman may also separate to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer of the USAF or
to accept an appointment as a warrant or commissioned officer of another branch of service. Voluntary Separation. Airmen may ask for early separation for the convenience of the
government if they meet the criteria. Entering an officer training program, pregnancy, conscientious objection, hardship, and early release to attend school are some of the reasons for
which members may be allowed to separate. Involuntary Separation. Physical conditions that interfere with duty performance or assignment
availability, inability to cope with parental responsibilities or military duty, or insufficient
retainability for required retraining, are reasons for involuntary discharge for the convenience of
the government. Defective enlistment (fraudulent or erroneous) is also a basis for discharge. Airmen are subject to discharge for cause based on such factors as unsatisfactory performance, substance abuse, misconduct, or in the interest of national security. 20.28. Service Characterization
Airmen who do not qualify for reenlistment receive a discharge without regard to their remaining
military service obligation. The service characterization depends upon the reason for the discharge
and the member’s military record in the current enlistment or period of service. The service of
members administratively discharged under DAFI 36-3211, Military Separations, may be
characterized as honorable, general (under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable
conditions. Honorable. Members separating at their expiration of term of service, or voluntarily or
involuntarily separating for the convenience of the government, are characterized as honorable. An honorable discharge is given when the quality of the member’s service generally has met USAF
<!-- Page 397 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
397
standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty, or a member’s service is otherwise so
meritorious that any other characterization would be inappropriate. General (under honorable conditions). A general (under honorable conditions) discharge is
given when a member’s service has been determined to be honest and faithful, but significant
negative aspects of the member’s conduct or performance outweigh positive aspects of the
Airman’s military record. Under Other Than Honorable Conditions. An under other than honorable conditions discharge
is given based upon a pattern of behavior, or one or more acts or omissions, that constitute a
significant departure from the conduct expected of an Airman. This characterization can be given
only if the member is offered an administrative discharge board or if a discharge is unconditionally
requested in lieu of trial by court-martial. Discharge in Lieu of Trial by Court-Martial. If charges have been preferred against an Airman
and if the Uniform Code of Military Justice authorizes punitive discharge as punishment for any
of the offenses preferred, the Airman may request an administrative discharge instead of trial by
court-martial. There is no guarantee; however, that the Airman’s request will be granted. 20.29. Air Force Discharge Review Board
The Air Force Discharge Review Board affords former USAF members the opportunity to request
review of their discharge (except for a bad-conduct discharge, dishonorable discharge, or dismissal
by general court-martial) within 15 years of the date of separation. The objective of a discharge
review is to examine an applicant’s administrative discharge and consider changing the
characterization of service, the reason for discharge, and the re-enlistment code (when applicable), based on standards of propriety or equity. Airmen separated under circumstances (except
retirement) that make them ineligible for reenlistment, and officers discharged under adverse
conditions, are briefed by the military personnel section at the time of their discharge about the
discharge review board process. They are provided with a discharge review fact sheet and an
application, DD Form 293, Application for the Review of Discharge from the Armed Forces of the
United States. A personal appearance before the discharge review board is a statutory right. The applicant or the
applicant’s counsel may appear before the board or address the board via video teleconference. Procedures allow the applicant latitude in presenting evidence, witnesses, and testimony in support
of the applicant’s case. A board may also review the case based on documentation in the military
record and any additional evidence provided by the applicant. 20.30. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records
The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest level of administrative
review for correcting military records. In most cases, applicants are members or former members
of the USAF. In some situations, a family member, heir, or legal representative (such as a guardian
or executor) of the member or former member with a proper interest, may request correction of
another person's military records when that person is incapable of acting on his or her own behalf, is missing, or is deceased. With a few exceptions, most records generated by the USAF may be
corrected by the board. Records addressed for change include, but are not limited to enlisted
performance reports, fitness test results, debts incurred, discharges and reenlistment/reentry
eligibility codes, survivor benefit plans, accumulated leave days, Article 15 actions, and
reinstatement into the USAF. Records may be changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct
an error or to remove an injustice. Applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based on the
