### Performance Feedback Assessment
The performance feedback assessment is a formal two-way communication between a rater and
ratee to discuss standards, responsibilities, expectations, and goals. Raters document the feedback
session to assess or discuss the objectives, standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee. Also, during feedback sessions, raters will provide the ratee information on Air Force benefits by
referring them to MyAirForceBenefits website (https://www.myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil). The
performance feedback assessment is designed to increase Airmen interaction and support at all
levels, provide Airmen an opportunity to discuss personal and professional goals, and assist
Airmen in achieving those goals. Once the performance feedback assessment has been completed, raters will give the original, completed, and signed worksheet to the ratee, and maintain copies of
all completed performance feedback assessments and all signed performance feedback
assessment notices, or appropriate statements (RegAF only). Unit commanders are responsible for developing a tracking mechanism for performance feedback
assessments and ensuring they are conducted properly. Raters’ raters/reviewing officials of
evaluations between the rater and the forced distributor/higher level reviewers (HLR) will monitor
personnel to ensure performance feedback assessments are conducted, as required. When a lowerlevel rater is not available due to unusual circumstances, or when officially assuming the
subordinate rater’s responsibilities, the raters’ rater will conduct performance feedback
assessment sessions in place of the rater. Ratees are responsible for knowing when their
performance feedback assessment sessions are due. When a required or requested performance
feedback assessment does not take place, ratees will notify the rater and, if necessary, the raters’
rater. Performance feedback assessments are mandatory for officers up through the grade of Colonel, and for all enlisted RegAF and Air Reserve Component personnel. For student officers receiving
DAF Form 475, Education/Training Report, or for enlisted personnel in initial or advanced skills
training, a performance feedback assessment is not required, but may be given at the discretion of
school leadership. For performance evaluations completed on non-rated initial or advanced skills
training students, documented academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156, Student
Training Report, will serve in-lieu of the mandatory mid-term performance feedback assessment. The mid-term performance feedback assessment is a mandatory supporting document to be routed
with the performance evaluation but will not be made a matter of official record. 8.2. Guidance for Conducting Performance Feedback Assessment Sessions
Raters should be impartial and (may include video conferencing) provide honest, realistic
feedback. The private, face-to-face feedback session is an opportunity to inform an individual of
where they need improvement, determine if an individual needs more information, and set future
expectations. It also lets the ratee know what needs to be done before the evaluation performance
report is due. Feedback, whether positive or negative, needs to be specific. Specific positive
comments reinforce the behavior, and specific negative comments focus the attention where the
ratee needs improvement. Raters may only conduct sessions by telephone in unusual

circumstances where face-to-face sessions are impractical. 8.3. Performance Feedback Assessment Worksheet
Performance feedback assessment worksheets are used to document formal communication
between raters and ratees and may be used on the ratee’s evaluation. Each section of the form
should be filled out to the best of the ratee’s and rater’s ability. The ratee completes Section III
on their own and reviews Section IX (AB thru Technical Sergeant) or VIII (Master Sergeant thru
Chief Master Sergeant) prior to the feedback session. The areas following Section III are
completed by the rater. Sections are broken into various categories to allow raters to objectively
indicate the ratee’s level of performance in each area. There are three different performance
feedback assessment worksheets, designated for use based on the ratee’s grade. AF Form 724, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (2Lt thru Col)
In addition to the AF Form 724, raters are required to use the AF Form 724-A, Airman
Comprehensive Assessment Addendum, for officers. It is optional for raters use the AF Form 724A for SNCOs as an informal guiding document to supplement the performance feedback. 8.4. When to Conduct the Airman Comprehensive Assessment
In most cases, the military personnel flight will provide a computer-generated performance
feedback assessment notice to raters and ratees within 30 days of when supervision begins
(identifying initial or follow-up performance feedback assessment sessions, as required), and
again halfway between the time supervision began and the projected performance report closeout date (identifying mid-term performance feedback assessment session requirements). The
notice serves to remind raters that a performance feedback assessment session is due; however, failure to receive a performance feedback assessment notice does not justify failing to hold a
required session. The Air National Guard does not currently have an automated process for
performance feedback assessment notices and may use an alternate form of communication to
notify raters and ratees of performance feedback assessment schedules. All initial performance feedback assessment sessions must be conducted within the first 60 days
of when supervision begins. This will be the ratee’s only initial feedback until there is a change
of reporting official. The rater must conduct a mid-term performance feedback assessment session
midway between the date supervision begins and the next evaluation projected close-out date. For
the end-of-reporting period, the rater conducts the performance feedback assessment session
within 60 days after the evaluation has been accomplished. Note: Ratees may request feedback
as long as 60 days have passed since the last session. For Chief Master Sergeants and colonels, the initial performance feedback assessment is the only feedback required. If the ratee is due an
annual evaluation and the period of supervision is less than 150 days, the rater conducts the
performance feedback assessment approximately 60 days before the projected evaluation closeout date. For Lieutenant through Captain only, if an evaluation is due to a change of reporting
official, the new rater will do initial feedback. This feedback may be accomplished using the
performance feedback assessment worksheet, but documentation is not required. For Airman Basic, Airman, or Airman First Class (with less than 20 months of Total Active Federal Military
Service), after the initial feedback, a mid-term performance feedback assessment session is
conducted every 180 days until the rater writes a performance report or a change of reporting
official occurs. <!-- Page 154 -->

### Performance Evaluation Administration
The performance evaluation system is designed to provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative
record of performance and potential. The key aspects associated with the evaluation system are
how well the individual does his or her job. It is important for supervisors to help subordinates
understand their strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts contribute to the mission. Supervisors must understand how and when to employ the officer and enlisted evaluation systems
and the civilian performance program. Access to Evaluations. Evaluations are “Controlled Unclassified Information” forms and must
be marked, protected, and accessed accordingly. The office with custodial responsibility is
responsible for determining if a requestor’s official duties require access. Classified Information and Security Classification. Do not enter classified information in any
section of the evaluation; this includes attachments to evaluations, referral documents, and
endorsements to referral documents. If an entry would result in the release of classified
information, use the word “Data Masked” in place of that entry. In cases where the evaluator is
assigned to a classified organization or location, enter “Data Masked” for organization
nomenclature and nothing more. Specific instructions for completing evaluations, with reference
to proper formatting, appropriate raters/evaluators, HLR and Senior Raters, content, acronym use, classified information, and other details, are found in AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted
Evaluation Systems. 8.6. Performance Evaluation Uses
The officer and enlisted evaluation systems should be used with the following objectives in mind: Effectively communicate performance standards and expectations and provide meaningful
feedback on how those standards and expectations are being upheld. Provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and promotion potential based
on that performance. Provide sound information to assist in making talent management decisions. Document in the permanent record any substantiated allegation of a sex-related offense against
an Airman, regardless of grade, that results in conviction by court-martial, non- judicial
punishment, or other adverse administrative action. 8.7. Performance Evaluation Forms and Documentation
There are a number of forms/briefs, as listed below, used to document performance and potential
over the course of a ratee’s career. These forms are considered when making promotion
recommendations, selections or propriety actions, selective continuations, involuntary
separations, selective early retirements, assignments, school nominations and selections, and
other management decisions. Note: The ratee’s grade or projected grade on the static close-out
date is used to determine the appropriate performance report form. DAF Form 77, Letter of Evaluation (LOE)

### Performance Evaluation Responsibilities
Unit commanders will ensure supervisors are properly trained and educated on how to write a
performance evaluation. Unit commanders must conduct a record review of all personnel assigned
to and/or transferred into his or her command to ensure knowledge of and familiarization with the
Airman’s history of sex-related offenses resulting in conviction by courts-martial, non-judicial
punishment, or other adverse administrative action. This is accomplished to reduce the likelihood
that repeat offenses will escape the notice of current, subsequent, or higher-level commanders. Review of the record will be conducted by the immediate commander of the Airman at the lowest
unit level. These responsibilities will not be delegated. Raters, reviewers, Senior Rater, and HLRs must consider the contents of Unfavorable Information
Files or Personal Information Files when preparing a performance evaluation. They must assess
the ratee’s performance, what the ratee did, how well he or she did it, and the ratee’s potential
based on that performance throughout the rating period. Ratees must review evaluations prior to them becoming a matter of record. This is the time to
bring typos, spelling errors, and inaccurate data to the attention of the rater. When the ratee signs
the evaluation, he or she is not concurring with the content, but rather acknowledging receipt of
the completed evaluation, and certifying they have reviewed the evaluation for administrative
errors. If the ratee disagrees with any comments and/or ratings on the report, the ratee may file an
appeal after the evaluation becomes a matter of record. 8.9. Documenting Performance
Include at least one performance statement in each section of the evaluation being accomplished. A performance statement is a standalone sentence that must include two elements: 1) the behavior
or action taken by an Airman; and 2) the impact, results, or outcome of that behavior or action. Adverse Information. The expectation for performance evaluations is fair and equal treatment of
all, and enforcement of the same behavior in subordinates. The goal is for fair and accurate
evaluations to help ensure the best qualified members are identified for positions of higher
<!-- Page 156 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
156
responsibility. Failure to document misconduct that deviates from the core values of the USAF is
a disservice to all Airmen who serve with honor and distinction. Situations involving convictions
or violations of criminal law must be handled appropriately and in accordance with required
timelines and procedures. In all cases, when comments are included in performance evaluations, they must be specific, outlining the event and any corrective action taken. Comments, such as “conduct unbecoming…”
or “an error in judgment led to an off-duty incident…,” are too vague. Examples of valid comments
are “Master Sergeant Smith drove while intoxicated, for which he received an Article 15” and
“Captain Jones made improper sexually suggestive and harassing comments to a squadron
member, for which he received a Letter of Reprimand.” Some aspects of performance that may
need to be considered when preparing an accurate assessment of behavior include: Impact of the misconduct on the USAF as an institution (Did it bring discredit on the USAF?). Impact of the misconduct on, and its relationship to, the ratee’s duties (Did it affect the ratee’s
ability to fulfill assigned duties?). Impact of the misconduct on the USAF mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was unit
morale affected?). Grade, assignment, and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a sensitive job? Did the ratee know
better?). Number of separate violations and frequency of the misconduct (Is this an isolated or repeated
incident?). Consequences of the misconduct (Did it result in death, injury, or loss of/damage to military
or civilian property?). Other dissimilar acts of misconduct during the reporting period (Is the ratee establishing a
pattern of misconduct?). Existence of unique, unusual, or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and
unprovoked or were there aggravating factors or events?). Adverse Actions. For the purpose of this policy, an adverse action includes reportable civilian
offenses or convictions, other than convictions for motor vehicle violations that do not require a
court appearance. Specifically, convictions required to be reported include: 1) any finding of guilt; 2) any plea of guilty; 3) any plea of no contest or nolo contendere; 4) any plea of guilty in exchange
for a deferred prosecution or diversion program; or 5) any other similar disposition of civilian
criminal charges. In the event a commander or military law-enforcement official receives information that a member
of the USAF, under the jurisdiction of another military department, has become subject to a
conviction for which a report is required by this section, the commander or military lawenforcement official receiving such information shall forward it to the member’s immediate
commander. Complaints of sex-related offenses against a member, regardless of grade, resulting in conviction
by court-martial, non-judicial punishment, or adverse administrative action, require a mandatory
notation on the member’s next performance report or training report and promotion
recommendation form (if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the selection
record). Sex-related offenses include violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or attempts
to commit related offenses. <!-- Page 157 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
157
If a member has been convicted by a court-martial or if the senior rater decides to file any adverse
information in an Airman’s selection record, comments relating to the ratee’s behavior are
mandatory on the ratee’s next performance or training report and promotion recommendation form
(if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the selection record). The
evaluation becomes a referral for the performance report or training report. Extraordinary Cases. Raters may request a waiver of the mandatory requirement to document
civilian convictions for good cause. The waiver request will route from the rater, through any
required additional rater and the ratee’s commander, to the ratee’s senior rater, and, if endorsed, be forwarded to the major command commander, or authorized final approval authority. <!-- Page 158 -->

## Section 8C — Reenlistments and Continuation

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**

Chapter 8—ASSESSMENTS AND RECOGNITION SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
## Section 8C — Reenlistments and Continuation B B C C C

### Selective Reenlistment Program
The Selective Reenlistment Program applies
to all enlisted personnel by which
commanders/civilians, directors, and supervisors evaluate first-term, second-term, and career
Airmen to ensure the USAF retains those who consistently demonstrate the capability and
willingness of maintaining high professional standards. First-term Airmen receive selective
reenlistment consideration when they are within 15 months of their expiration of term of service. Second-term and career Airmen with less than 19 years of total active federal military service are
considered within 13 months of the original expiration of term of service. Career Airmen receive
selective reenlistment consideration within 13 months of completing 20 years of total active federal
military service. Career Airmen who have served beyond 20 years of total active federal military
service receive selective reenlistment consideration each time they are within 13 months of their
original expiration of term of service. 8.11. Selective Reenlistment Program Considerations
Commanders and civilian directors consider enlisted performance report ratings, unfavorable
information from any substantiated source, the Airman’s willingness to comply with USAF
standards, and the Airman’s ability (or lack thereof) to meet required training and duty
performance levels when determining if a member may reenlist. Supervisors should carefully
evaluate the Airman’s duty performance and review the Airman’s personnel records, to include
the DAF Form 1137, Unfavorable Information File Summary, if applicable, before making a
recommendation to unit commanders and civilian directors concerning the Airman’s career
potential. Non-Selectee. If an Airman is not selected for reenlistment, an DAF Form 418, Selective
Reenlistment Program (SRP) Consideration/Denial of Continued Service for Airmen, is
completed, and the Airman is informed of the decision. The commander sends the completed form
to the military personnel flight after the Airman signs and initials the appropriate blocks. The
commander must make sure the Airman understands the right to appeal the decision. The Airman
has up to three calendar days to render an appeal intent. The Airman must submit the appeal to the
military personnel flight within 10 calendar days of the date he or she renders the appeal intent on
the form. Appeal Authority. The specific appeal authority is based on an Airman’s total active federal
military service. The appeal authority for first-term Airmen and career Airmen who will complete
at least 20 years of total active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service
appeal selective reenlistment program non-selection is the respective group commander. The
appeal authority for second-term and career Airmen who will complete fewer than 16 years of total
active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service is the respective wing
commander. The appeal authority for second-term and career Airmen who will complete at least
## years of total active federal military service but fewer than 20 years of total active federal
military service on their current expiration of term of service, is the Secretary of the Air Force. The decision of the appeal authority is final. The appeal authority’s decision is documented, and
the Airman is advised of the outcome. Commanders may also conduct selective reenlistment
consideration at any time outside the standardized window. <!-- Page 159 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

### Noncommissioned Officer Career Status Program
The Noncommissioned Officer Career Status Program extends the length of reenlistments for
RegAF Airmen. All Airmen who have been selected for continued service by their
commander/civilian director (to include those with approved waivers), and who have at least 12
years total active federal military service on date of discharge (day prior to reenlistment) will be
reenlisted for an unspecified period. These Airmen will serve up to their High Year of Tenure
based on current grade, or if promoted, projected grade unless sooner separated by USAF policy
or law under the NCO Career Status Program. Airmen who serve 20 or more years of total active
federal military service may retire, if otherwise eligible, no later than the first day of the month
following High Year of Tenure. This program streamlines the reenlistment and extension process and alleviates unnecessary
administrative actions for Airmen, supervisor chains, and military personnel flights. 8.13. Career Job Reservation Program
Because of various career force size and composition restrictions, there are times when the USAF
must place a limit on the number of authorized first-term Airmen who may reenlist. The Career
Job Reservation (CJR) Program exists to assist in the management of first-term Airmen
reenlistments by AFSC prevent surpluses and shortages. All eligible first-term Airmen must have
an approved CJR to reenlist. Airmen are automatically placed on the career job applicant list on
the first duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months on their current enlistment
(59 months for six-year enlistees), but no later than the last duty day of the month during which
they complete 43 months on their current enlistment (67 months for six- year enlistees). To keep
their approved CJR, Airmen must reenlist on or before the CJR expiration date. CJRs may be
constrained (limited) quotas or unconstrained (unlimited) quotas. Constrained: First-term Airmen in constrained AFSCs have limited quotas, when available and
compete for a CJR. Commanders or civilian directors recommend award of CJRs to Airmen in
constrained AFSCs where an allocation has been awarded. Approval of CJRs are made at the group
commander level or equivalent. Commanders or civilian directors may recommend First Term
Airmen for award of a CJR anytime during the Airman’s CJR window. Airmen outside their CJR
window are not eligible for award of a CJR. Airmen’s evaluations must reflect that the member
has met the minimum expectation and not have an unfavorable information file, lost time, or
record of active nonjudicial punishment on their current enlistment in order to be considered for a
CJR. The Airman’s job performance, demonstrated leadership, how the Airmen exemplifies
USAF core values, and ability to succeed in the AFSC should also be considered. Upon Airmen
entering their CJR window, commanders or civilian directors are encouraged to advise Airmen
on their potential for a CJR and when appropriate, encourage retraining. When constrained AFSCs are implemented, Air Force Personnel Center issues CJR quotas on a
fiscal year basis and selection authorities may consider Airmen by board, nomination packages, etc. Airmen who are on the CJR waiting list and whose AFSC is removed from the constrained list
will receive a CJR. Airmen who are removed from the waiting list prior to the AFSC being
removed, will not receive supplemental consideration. If eligible, Airmen qualify for award of a
CJR when an allocation exists, and the Airman is in their CJR eligibility window. When the group
commander (or equivalent) approves an Airman for award of a CJR, Air Force Personnel Center
will verify an allocation exists and will reduce the number of remaining CJRs accordingly. Note: Approved CJRs do not expire until the Airman’s date of separation. Unconstrained: Airmen in unconstrained AFSCs do not compete for a CJR. Airmen are
automatically awarded the CJR on the first duty day of the month during which they complete 35
<!-- Page 160 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
160
months on their current enlistment (59 months for six-year enlistees), but no later than the last duty
day of the month during which they complete 43 months on their current enlistment (67 months
for six-year enlistees), provided they have been selected for continued service by their
commander/civilian director under the selective reenlistment program. 8.14. Enlistment Extensions
Airmen serving on an active enlistment may request an enlistment extension if he or she has a
service-directed retainability reason and the extension is in the best interest of the USAF. Extensions are granted in whole-month increments. For example, if the individual needs 15½
months of retainability for an assignment, the individual must request a full 16-month extension. Voluntary extensions for all Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the
event that USAF specialties are constrained, the Air Staff may limit first-term Airmen extensions
to a specified period. Certain situations (such as citizenship pending) may warrant exceptions to
policy. Airmen may be eligible to request an extension of enlistment to establish a date of
separation at high year of tenure to separate or retire. Normally, Airmen must be within two years
of their high year of tenure before they can extend. Note: Once approved, an extension has the
legal effect of the enlistment agreement by extending the Airman’s period of obligated service. Enlistment extensions can only be canceled when the reason for the extension no longer exists, as
long as the Airman has not already entered into the extension. 8.15. Selective Retention Bonus
The Selective Retention Bonus (SRB) Program is a monetary incentive paid to Airmen serving in
certain selected critical military skills who reenlist for additional obligated service. The bonus is
intended to encourage the reenlistment of sufficient numbers of qualified enlisted personnel in
military skills with either demonstrated retention shortfalls or high training costs. Airmen in SRB
skills who reenlist or extend their enlistment in the active duty for at least three years are eligible
for an SRB provided they meet all criteria listed in DAFI 36-2606, Reenlistment and Extension
of Enlistment in the United States Air Force. Airmen can expect to serve in the SRB specialty for
the entire enlistment for which the bonus was paid. SRB designations are established by zones, which are determined by the total active federal
military service of Airmen at the time of reenlistment or the date they enter the extension. Eligible
Airmen may receive an SRB in each zone (A, B, C or E), but only one SRB per zone. Zone A applies to Airmen reenlisting between 17 months and 6 years. Zone B applies to Airmen reenlisting between 6 and 10 years. Zone C applies to Airmen reenlisting between 10 and 14 years. Zone E applies to Airmen reenlisting between 18 and 20 years. SRBs are calculated using one month's base pay, multiplied by the number of years reenlisting or
extending, multiplied by the SRB multiple as listed on the authorized SRB listing. The maximum
SRB per zone is $100,000. Note: The Airman's base pay on the date of discharge is used to
calculate the SRB. Therefore, if an Airman was promoted to Staff Sergeant on 1 May and reenlisted
on 1 May, the SRB would be calculated on the base pay of the day prior to the reenlistment as
Senior Airman. 8.16. USAF Retraining Program
Retraining is a force management tool used primarily to balance career fields (officer and enlisted)
across all AFSCs, and to ensure sustainability of career fields. Retraining also provides a means to
<!-- Page 161 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
161
return disqualified Airmen to a productive status. Although Airmen may be selected for
involuntary retraining based on USAF needs, the retraining program allows a limited number of
Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths in the USAF. The Online Retraining Advisory
is a living document found on myFSS, maintained by the Air Force Personnel Center as a key tool
used to advise members of retraining opportunities. For additional information on retraining
eligibility and application procedures, refer to: AFMAN 36-2100. First-Term Airmen Retraining Program. First-term Airmen assigned to the Continental United
States may apply not earlier than the first duty day of the month during which they complete 35
months of their current enlistment (59 months for six-year enlistees), but not later than the last
duty day of the 43rd month of their current enlistment (67 months for six-year enlistees). First-term Airmen assigned outside the Continental United States may apply for retraining nine to
## months prior to the date they are eligible to return from overseas if serving within their normal
first-term window (35th month for four-year enlistees or 59th month for six-year enlistees). Airmen with an indefinite return from overseas date must complete the original tour length before
departing for retraining. On the last duty day of each month, the Air Force Personnel Center selects the most eligible
Airmen for retraining based on quality indicators of most recent performance report rating, current
grade, projected grade, previous two performance report ratings, date of rank, total active federal
military service date, aptitude qualification examination score (electrical, mechanical, administrative, general), Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, Part II, and requested AFSC
preferences. Noncommissioned Officer Retraining Program. The NCO retraining program is designed to
retrain second-term and career Airmen from overage USAF specialties into shortage specialties to
optimize the enlisted force and to best meet current and future mission needs. Airmen possessing
a secondary or additional AFSC in a shortage skill may be returned to the shortage skill if in the
best interest of the USAF. Phases I and II. The NCO retraining program consists of two phases. The objective of Phase I is
to obtain volunteer applicants from identified overage AFSCs to fill requirements in shortage
specialty codes. All Airmen with retraining ‘out’ objectives may apply for any available specialty
codes with retraining ‘in’ objectives for which they qualify. During Phase I, if sufficient
applications are not received and retraining objectives for the fiscal year are not met, implementation of Phase II is necessary. In Phase II, Airmen will be selected for mandatory
retraining based on USAF needs to balance the force. The master vulnerability list is used to select
Airmen for mandatory retraining. 8.17. Officer Crossflow and Reclassification Programs
Tools and procedures are available to address career field manning imbalances and shape the
officer force within authorized, funded end-strength. The Nonrated Line Crossflow Program
addresses manning shortages and overages by conducting a crossflow panel when needed to select
the best qualified officers to fill the required vacancies. The Missileer Crossflow Program is a
process ensuring the Nuclear and Missile Operations (13N) Air Force specialty remains balanced
for sustainment by crossflowing excess officers at the four-year point back to donor career fields. Out-of-cycle crossflow requests, as well as initial skills training reclassification, are additional
programs to ensure the balance of officer career fields. <!-- Page 162 -->

## Section 8D — Awards and Decorations B B C C C

### Awards and Decorations Program
USAF members make many personal and professional sacrifices to ensure the USAF accomplishes
its mission. Acts of valor, heroism, exceptional service, and outstanding achievement deserve
special recognition. The Department of the Air Force Military Awards and Decorations Program, as outlined in DAFMAN 36-2806, Military Awards: Criteria and Procedures, is designed to
recognize units, organizations, and individuals, and to foster morale, provide incentive, and instill
esprit de corps. Individuals or units considered for awards and decorations under this program must
clearly demonstrate sustained and superior performance. 8.19. DoD Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Awards
DoD campaign, expeditionary, and service awards recognize participation in military campaigns and
expeditions, significant military operations, personal military service, or attainment of a requirement. Military members should keep copies of their travel orders and their travel vouchers as documented
proof of entitlement to service and campaign awards. Several service and campaign awards are
briefly described here. Additional information on campaign, expeditionary, and service awards
can be found in DAFMAN 36-2806 or in DoDM 1348.33 Vol. 2, DoD Military Decorations and
Awards: DoD Service Awards - Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Medals. See Attachment
7, Devices. Prisoner of War Medal. The Prisoner of War Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving
in any capacity with the U.S. Armed Forces, was taken prisoner and held captive while engaged
in an action against an enemy of the U.S., engaged in military operations involving conflict with
an opposing foreign force, or served with friendly forces engaged in an armed conflict against an
opposing armed force in which the U.S. was not a belligerent party. National Defense Service Medal. The National Defense Service Medal recognizes honorable
active military service (to include members of the Selected Reserve in good standing, members of
other than the Selected Reserve called to active duty, cadets in the Air Force Academy, and DAF
members who have completed Basic Training) during periods of conflict or national crisis, as
designated by SecDef. Antarctica Service Medal. The Antarctica Service Medal is authorized to any person who was a
member of an Antarctic expedition, a member of a permanent Antarctica station, or for service in
contiguous waters. Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal is awarded to
members of the U.S. Armed Forces who participated in United States military operations, operations in direct support of the United Nations, or operations of assistance for friendly foreign
nations. Service members who may be eligible are those who participated in or engaged in direct
support of an operation for 30 consecutive days in the area of operations (or the full period of
operations) or for 60 non-consecutive days when engaged in actual combat or equally hazardous

personnel appropriation order to RegAF. 8.20. Unit Awards
These awards are presented to military units that distinguish themselves during peacetime or in
action against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United States. To preserve the integrity of
unit awards, they are approved only to recognize acts or services clearly and distinctly outstanding
by nature and magnitude. The acts or services recognized must place the unit’s performance above
that of other units similar in composition and mission and be of such importance that they cannot
be appropriately recognized in any other way. Only one unit award is awarded for the same
achievement or service. The unit’s entire service must have been honorable during the
distinguished act. An organization may display the award elements of a unit award. Designated
subordinate units of the organization (except foreign units) may also share in the award; however, higher organizations may not. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a
period for which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly
contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. The five most common unit awards
worn by USAF members today are the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Gallant Unit Citation, the Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and the Air Force
Organizational Excellence Award. Presidential Unit Citation. The Presidential Unit Citation is the nation’s highest unit award. It is
awarded to units of the U.S. Armed Forces and cobelligerent nations, for extraordinary heroism in
action against an armed enemy on or after 7 December 1941. The unit must have displayed such
gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult
and hazardous conditions to have set it apart and above other units participating in the same
campaign. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would be required of an Air
Force C to an individual. Joint Meritorious Unit Award. The Joint Meritorious Unit Award recognizes joint units and
activities, such as a joint task force for meritorious achievement or service superior to that normally
expected. USAF members assigned or attached to the joint unit or joint task force awarded a Joint
Meritorious Unit Award may be eligible to wear the Joint Meritorious Unit Award ribbon. Gallant Unit Citation. The Gallant Unit Citation was approved by the Secretary of the Air Force
in March 2004 and is awarded to USAF units for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed
enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an
opposing foreign force on or after 11 September 2001. The unit must have performed with marked
distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it
apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The Gallant Unit Citation will
normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering
relatively brief time spans. Meritorious Unit Award. The Meritorious Unit Award was approved by the Secretary of the Air
Force in March 2004 and is awarded to USAF units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in
performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at
least 90 continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the
United States on or after 11 September 2001. Superior performance of normal missions alone will
not justify award of the Meritorious Unit Award. Service in a combat zone is not required, but
service must be directly related to the combat effort. The Meritorious Unit Award is not awarded
to any unit or component previously awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, Air Force
Organizational Excellence Award, or unit awards from other service components for the same act, achievement, or service. <!-- Page 165 -->

organization must have performed meritorious service or outstanding achievements that clearly set
the unit above and apart from similar units. Commanders must annually review the
accomplishments of their eligible subordinate units and recommend only those units that are truly
exceptional. Commanders send Air Force Outstanding Unit Award recommendations to their major
commands for consideration. Certain recommendations for the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award
are exempt from annual submission, such as recommendations for specific achievements, combat
operations, or conflict with hostile forces. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command
are recommended annually. Air Force Organizational Excellence Award. The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award
was established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force on 6 January 1954. The
Air Force Organizational Excellence Award has the same guidelines and approval authority as the
Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award is awarded
to unnumbered organizations, such as a major command, a field operating agency, a direct reporting
unit, the Office of the Chief of Staff, other Air Staff, and deputy assistant chief of staff agencies. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended annually. 8.21. DAF DoD Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Awards

A decoration is the formal recognition for personal excellence that requires individual nomination
and USAF or Department of Defense approval. Decorations are awarded in recognition for acts of
valor, heroism, courage, exceptional service, meritorious service, or outstanding achievement that
clearly place members above their peers and of such importance that the person cannot receive
proper recognition in any other way. When being considered for a decoration, the determining
factors involve the member’s level of responsibility, achievements, accomplishments, manner of
performance, and the impact of the accomplishment. Each decoration has specific performance
requirements for award, and an individual may receive only one decoration for any act, achievement, or period of service. Preparing a Decoration Recommendation. Although responsibility for submitting decoration
recommendations primarily falls on the immediate supervisor, any person, other than the
individual being recommended, having firsthand knowledge of the act, achievement, or service, may recommend or contribute to a decoration recommendation by providing evidence or
statements through the supervisor and chain of command of the member being recommended. Do

Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the highest decoration for heroism in military action that
can be awarded to a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. The Medal of Honor is awarded for
conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty while
engaged in action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations
involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces
engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a
belligerent party. The Medal of Honor is generally presented by the U.S. President to the recipient or the recipient’s
primary next of kin. Along with the prestige of being awarded the Medal of Honor for
distinguished acts of valor, recipients, by law, also receive special benefits under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, additional privileges, and entitlements. One example, although
not required by law or military regulation, is that members of the uniformed services are
encouraged to render salutes to recipients of the Medal of Honor as a matter of respect and
courtesy, whether or not they are in uniform, and regardless of rank or status. See Attachment 7, USAF Medal of Honor Recipients (and official record of location of birth, and date of death). Note: According to the U.S. Medal of Honor Historical Society, the first USAF recipient of the
Medal of Honor was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 19, 1967, to Major
Bernard F. Fisher for action in South Vietnam. There are three versions of the Medal of Honor, one for each of the military departments of the Department of Defense: Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, with slight variations in design. Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Department of the Navy
version and members of the Space Force are eligible to receive the Department of the Air Force
version. Air Force Cross. The Air Force Cross is the second highest decoration that can be awarded to a
member of the U.S. Armed Forces. The Air Force Cross is awarded for extraordinary heroism while
engaged in action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations
involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces
engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a
belligerent party. Actions that merit award of the Air Force Cross must be of such a high degree
that they are above those required for all other combat decorations, but do not merit award of the
Medal of Honor. Distinguished Service Medal. The Distinguished Service Medal is awarded for exceptionally
meritorious service to the nation in a duty of great responsibility. In wartime, a duty of great
responsibility is one that involves the exercise of authority or judgment in matters that decide the
successful operation of a major command, activity, installation, or major program. The discharge
of such duty must involve the acceptance and fulfillment of the obligation so as to greatly benefit
the interests of the United States. Silver Star. The Silver Star is the third-highest military combat decoration that can be awarded to
a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is awarded for gallantry in action while engaged in action
against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with
an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed
conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. Actions that merit the Silver Star must be of such a high degree that they are above those required
for all other combat decorations, but do not merit award of the Medal of Honor or an Air Force
Cross. Legion of Merit. The Legion of Merit is awarded to U.S. Armed Forces personnel for
exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding duties. Duties must have been
<!-- Page 169 -->

169
performed in a clearly exceptional manner. Foreign military personnel may be awarded the Legion
of Merit for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the
United States. Distinguished Flying Cross. The Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded for heroism or
extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight for actions that are entirely
distinctive, involving operations that are not routine. Airman’s Medal. The Airman’s Medal is awarded for heroism involving voluntary risk of life
under conditions other than those of conflict with an armed enemy of the United States. Bronze Star Medal. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded for heroism, valor, or meritorious
achievement or service (not involving participation in aerial flight) while engaged in an action
against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with
an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed
conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The
Bronze Star Medal is awarded for valor in combat to a lesser degree than required for award of the
Silver Star or the Legion of Merit. Purple Heart. The Purple Heart, as shown in Figure 8.2., is awarded for
wounds received or death after being wounded in any action against an enemy
of the United States, in any action with an opposing force of a foreign country
in which the U.S. Armed Forces are or have been engaged, while serving with
friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed
force in which the United States is not a belligerent party, as a result of an act
of any such enemy or opposing armed force, or as a result of an act of any
hostile foreign force. The Purple Heart is a decoration that a member earns
entitlement to rather than being awarded through recommendation. Note: Since 11 September 2001, the Purple Heart may be awarded to a service
member on active duty who is attacked by a foreign terrorist organization that
targeted a member of the U.S. Armed Forces due to such member’s status as
a member of the Armed Forces, unless the wound is the result of willful
misconduct of the member, may be awarded the Purple Heart. An attack by an
individual or entity shall be considered to be a foreign terrorist organization attack if the individual
or entity was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack, and the
attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization. Figure 8.2. Purple Heart
Air Medal. The Air Medal is awarded for heroism or meritorious achievement while participating
in aerial flight. The Air Medal is awarded to acts accomplished with distinction above and beyond
that expected of professional Airmen, but not of that warranting award of the Distinguished Flying
Cross. Aerial Achievement Medal. The Aerial Achievement Medal is awarded for sustained meritorious
achievement while participating in aerial flight. Meritorious Service Medal. The Meritorious Service Medal is awarded for outstanding
meritorious achievement. Air and Space Commendation Medal. The Air and Space Commendation medal is awarded for
distinctive meritorious achievement and service. Air and Space Achievement Medal. The Air and Space Achievement Medal is awarded for
outstanding achievement or meritorious service. <!-- Page 170 -->

### Special Trophies and Awards
The USAF sponsors various special trophies and awards programs. Special trophies and awards
are unique in that the commanders of major commands, field operating agencies, and direct
reporting units must nominate individuals to compete for these awards. In most cases, commanders
submit nominations annually. The competition among the nominees is keen. The commander’s
nomination alone serves as a meaningful recognition because nomination places the individual in
competition with the best in the USAF or the nation. Two examples of special trophies and awards
are the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Award and the Lance P. Sijan Award. DAFMAN 362806, lists various special trophies and awards programs. 8.24. Foreign Decorations, Unit Awards, and Service and Campaign Awards
The DAF does not issue certificates, medals, ribbons, emblems, devices, and badges awarded by
foreign governments. These items may be available commercially at the individual’s expense. DAFMAN 36-2806 provides additional guidance for accepting foreign decorations, unit awards, and service and campaign awards. Foreign Decorations. Decorations from foreign governments may be accepted only in recognition
of combat service or for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance. Foreign Unit Awards. Foreign unit awards are only authorized after the award has been officially
accepted by Department of Defense. Foreign Service and Campaign Awards. Several foreign campaign and service awards, to
include North Atlantic Treaty Organization awards, exist as recognition from a foreign
governmental authority for active combat service or outstanding or unusually meritorious
performance. Foreign campaign and service awards are only authorized after the award has been
officially accepted by Department of Defense. 8.25. Non-Military Awards
Non-military awards may consist of a certificate, decoration, or award in recognition of death, injury, exceptional performance, or meritorious public service awarded by a non-Federal entity. Non-military awards and decorations may only be accepted after receiving approval from an
official approval authority.
