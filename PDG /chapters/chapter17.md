### DAF Emergency Management Program
The ability of the DAF to carry out its mission of Great Power Competition directly depends on
continuance of the mission in the face of adversity. Challenges to mission accomplishment may
take on many forms, to include natural and man-made disasters, terrorist use of weapons of mass
destruction, and hostile attacks that threaten the United States and its interest. The DAF
Emergency Management (EM) Program was developed to ensure the readiness of our forces to
save lives; minimize the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore
operational capability in an all-hazards threat environments at DAF installations worldwide. 17.2. DAF EM Program Mission
The primary mission of the DAF EM Program is to prevent, protect, prepare for, respond to, and
recover from all hazards/threats that pose the greatest risk to lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and operational missions. The ancillary mission supports homeland defense and
provide support to civil and host nation authorities; antiterrorism programs; and the countering
weapons of mass destruction enterprise. The DAF EM Program accomplishes these missions
through the seven pillars of EM preparedness: Risk Management, Planning Framework, Common
Core Capabilities, Capability Evaluation and Validation, Program Management Reviews, Capability Investment Strategy, and Adaptation via Information. Brief definitions of the EM
Program mission areas are provided here: Prevention. Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. Protection. Protection provides the capabilities necessary to protect the installation against all
threats, hazards, and manmade or natural disasters. Response. Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response includes
immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs. Response also
includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation activities
designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable
outcomes. Recovery. The development, coordination, and execution of service- and site-restoration plans
for impacted communities and the reconstitution of government operations and services through
individual, private sector, nongovernmental, and public assistance programs that: identify needs
and define resources; provide housing and promote restoration; address long-term care and
treatment of affected persons; implement additional measures for community restoration; incorporate mitigation measures and techniques, as feasible; evaluate the incident to identify
lessons learned; and develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents. Mitigation. Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the
actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be
implemented prior to, during, or after an incident. DAF EM Program Structure. The DAF EM Program consists of personnel and organizations
<!-- Page 322 -->

322
aligned in various roles which generate interoperability to and through 1) operational levels, 2)
planning and risk management, 3) incident command and coordination, and 4) command and
control. The DAF EM Program is comprised of specific organizational offices and responders
known as the Disaster Response Force (DRF) that respond to disasters/incidents and manage and
conduct response operations. These specific offices and their responsibilities are briefly described
here and in further detail in DAFI 10-2501, Emergency Management Program. Emergency Communications Center (ECC). The ECC is a 24-hour a day, seven days a week
operation and incorporates the core functions of fire and emergency services, security forces, and
medical dispatch. ECCs provide emergency communications, alarm, sensor, and video
monitoring, incident or event communications supports, tactical channel assignments, emergency
notification, responder reachback capability, and notification of an emergency to the medical
treatment facilities. Incident Commander (IC). The IC is responsible for all incident activities, including developing
strategies and tactics and ordering and releasing resources. The IC has overall authority and
responsibility for conducting and managing incident operations at the incident site. First Responders. First responders include Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES), medical, security forces, and other personnel who immediately engage in activities to save lives, stabilize
the incident, and prevent further property damage. Emergency Responders. Emergency responders are the response elements of a DRF that deploy
after the first responders to expand IC capabilities and perform support functions. Emergency
responders include but are not limited to the follow-on elements of EM, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) defense specialists, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers, and mortuary affairs personnel. Specialized and Support Teams. Teams are formed from the existing installation and unit
personnel to support emergency response and/or recovery operations. Examples include Damage
Assessment, Search and Recovery, Aircraft Crash Damaged or Disabled Recovery, Spill
Response, Hydrazine Response Team, Emergency Family Assistance, Disaster Mental Health, Medical Response Teams, Contingency Contracting, Bioenvironmental Engineering, and others. Control Centers. Control Centers are activated during the EOC activation and provide expertise
and resource support to the EOC director and serve as the command and control node for all
installation units tasked in the Installation Emergency Management Plan. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC is the installation’s critical function to address
imminent or realized threats/hazards and coordinate support to the incident command, on-scene
personnel, and/or other EOCs. Command Post. The Command Post is a full-time, 24/7 Command and Control (C2) node, directly responsible to commander(s) and serves as the focal point of operations, including the
receipt and dissemination of orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of assigned
forces and operations. Crisis Action Team (CAT). The CAT is the top echelon of installation mission continuation and
sustainment. The CAT includes senior officers and senior enlisted leaders across the A-Staff and
supporting units. Members of joint, civilian partners, and/or host nation partners may also be
present. The CAT supports the installation commander by assessing the situation, determining
mission priorities, and directing subordinate units. Note: The CAT is intended to focus on mission
continuation and sustainment and not the management of the incident. <!-- Page 323 -->

### Expect the Unexpected
Natural disasters, man-made hazards, and technological hazards can create emergency conditions
in a wide variety, magnitude, scope, urgency, and degree of damage and destruction. Disasters or
incidents resulting from a threat or hazard can occur at any time with little or no advance warning. These incidents can be local or widespread, predictable, or unpredictable. Emergency plans help
prepare for and mitigate the impact of these threats on an installation, personnel, and the mission. 17.4. Installation Emergency Plans
Installations must develop plans for the hazards likely to affect their areas based on appropriate
response, mitigation, and recovery procedures. Installation emergency management plans provide
comprehensive guidance for emergency responses to various incidents. Information on these
types of hazards is provided here. Natural Disasters. These types of disasters are non-routine events that occur and cause severe
damage that may require assistance. This includes hurricanes/typhoons, tornadoes, storms, highwater, high winds, tidal waves, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, mudslides, snowstorms, fires, floods, explosions, and droughts. Technological Hazards. These are man-made events caused by a malfunction in a technological
structure or human error in controlling the technology. Technological disasters can be as serious
as a natural disaster and can cause loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic
disruptions, or environmental degradation. They can happen with little to no warning. Examples
include hazardous materials release and nuclear power plant failures. Man-Made Hazards. This is an event that is non-routine and exceeds the capacity of the affected
area to respond to in a way that saves lives, preserves property, and maintains the affected region’s
social, ecological, economic, and political stability. These disasters include technological hazards, such as hazardous material releases and spills, acts of terrorism, active shooters, and nuclear
accidents. Other examples include crime, arson, civil disorder, war, biological/chemical threat, cyber-attacks, pollution, fires, and transportation accidents. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Hazards. CBRN hazards, to include
toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials (TIC/TIMs), cause adverse effects
through deliberate release and dissemination. Terrorist threat or use of CBRN materials are an
emerging transnational threat used as asymmetric measures of intent. Defense against these
threats requires all DAF personnel to plan, prepare, respond, and recover from CBRN incidents. Each threat agent presents a unique hazard, more information regarding these threats can be found
in DAFI 10-2503, CBRN Defense Program. Chemical Agents. A chemical substance that is intended for use in military operations to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate mainly through its physiological effects. Chemical agents, categorized according to their physiological effects, include lung damaging agents (choking), blister agents, blood agents, incapacitating agents, and nerve agents. Chemical agents can be
delivered through a variety of means, such as tactical ballistic missiles, bombs, artillery, grenades, mines, and spray attacks. Due to their persistent nature, nerve and blister agents pose as a primary
threat to air bases. <!-- Page 324 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
324
Biological Agents. A microorganism (or a toxin derived from it) that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or causes the deterioration of materiel. Biological agents include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins cultured from living organisms. These agents may be found as liquid
droplets, aerosols, or dry powders, and can be adapted and disseminated through any of these
forms as adversarial weapons. Symptoms of biological attacks may not be experienced
immediately after contact. Each agent has a different exposure (incubation) period before
infection. Radiological and Nuclear. Radiation is a broad term that applies to a wide range of phenomena. Light (infrared to ultraviolet), radiofrequency emissions, and microwaves are all forms of
radiation known as nonionizing radiation. In general, nonionizing radiation produces heat when
it interacts with the body. In contrast, ionizing radiation has sufficient energy to produce ions
when it interacts with matter (including the human body). Radiation causes harmful effects as it
alters or destroys cell processes and structures essential for the normal functioning of cells. Adversaries may disseminate radioactive materials across an area without a nuclear detonation. However, adversaries may also disseminate radioactive materials by detonating nuclear weapons
at various altitudes to include subsurface, surface, airburst, or high altitude. The primary concerns
of a nuclear detonation include blast/shock, thermal radiation (heat), ionizing radiation, and
ballistic debris for surface and shallow subsurface bursts. Nuclear blasts may also pose an
electromagnetic pulse hazard that can cause widespread communications or electrical problems. Toxic Industrial Chemical. A chemical developed or manufactured for use in industrial
operations or research by industry, government, or academia that poses a hazard. Toxic Industrial Material. A generic term for toxic, chemical, biological, or radioactive
substances in solid, liquid, aerosolized, or gaseous form that may be used, or stored for use, for
industrial, commercial, medical, military, or domestic purposes. Most toxic industrial materials
present a vapor (inhalation) hazard and may also reduce the oxygen concentration below that
required to support life. In the event of a toxic industrial material incident, the most important
action is to immediately evacuate to an area outside the hazard’s path, if feasible. It is important
to be aware that the protective mask, ensemble, and military standard collective protection filters
are not designed to provide protection from toxic industrial materials. If evacuation is impractical, implement shelter-in-place procedures. <!-- Page 325 -->

### Preparedness and Protection Procedures
DAF installations must take actions to protect, prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate
the effects of an attack or incident to ensure we can conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive
operations in a contested environment. Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction and CBRN
threats requires extraordinary preparedness. Established and conducting preparedness actions
effectively and efficiently will increase the protection of mission critical resources and force
survivability. Actions should be considered mission critical and given a high priority when the
threat of an enemy attack is high. Installations will establish multiple actions to counter these
attacks during the preparedness phase, often dependent on the intelligence, the installation’s threat
probabilities, and recommendations provided by subject matter experts. DAF personnel should
understand the importance of knowing an installation’s preparedness actions well before an
attack. 17.6. DAF Warning and Notification Signals
Emergency Notification Signals. Every DAF installation must have a rapid and effective system
to quickly disseminate emergency notifications and information such as watches, warning, evacuation routes, and protective actions. When a disaster or incident affecting the installation is
imminent or in-progress, personnel must respond to directions communicated over mass warning
and notification systems or other communication channels, whether visual or audible. Personnel
should be familiar with the installation’s warning and notification systems and are highly
encouraged to enroll in mobile device notifications to ensure prompt, informed, and ready
responses to local emergencies. Attack Warning Signals. These signals are used to notify personnel of warnings or impending
attacks. The warnings may be communicated through mass notification and warning systems, display of alarm condition flags, or through other communication channels. Attack warning
signals are used to posture installations for attacks, warn of attacks in progress, initiate post attack
recover actions, and return the installation to normal state of readiness. Note: attack warning
signal variations may be used in some geographical regions. Personnel will be notified of these
variations before departure of home station and/or upon arrival into the region. Three to Five Minute Steady Tone. The three-to-five-minute steady tone indicates a disaster or
incident is imminent or in progress. Individual actions are to be alert, take cover or evacuate to
safety, follow instructions, and account for personnel. Three to Five Minute Wavering Tone. The three-to-five-minute wavering tone indicates an
attack or hostile act is imminent or in progress. Individual actions are to be alert, execute security
measures, follow instructions, and account for personnel. Lockdown, Lockdown, Lockdown. The announcement lockdown, lockdown, lockdown
indicates an active shooter incident is in progress. Individual actions are to remain calm and
implement lockdown procedures. Shelter-in-Place. The announcement indicates a natural disaster warning or a technological
disaster warning requiring personnel to immediately take shelter indoors and perform actions
according to the Emergency Action Plan to protect personnel within the building from the hazards. <!-- Page 326 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
326
Actions for natural disasters may include taking refuge in an interior room without windows and
doors and taking cover. Actions for technological disasters may include taking refuge in a predesignated room, shutting off heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, and covering vents and
doors with plastic. Alarm Green. Attack is not probable. MOPP 0 (or as directed)

*Limited Release – Post Attack Reconnaissance Teams
*General Release – Mission-essential personnel only
All Clear. The announcement all clear indicates the immediate disaster or threat has ended. Individual actions are to remain alert, account for personnel, and report hazards, injuries, and
damages. 17.7. Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) Levels
MOPP levels are established to quickly communicate the required individual protective
equipment and protection levels for in-place forces to take in the event of CBRN operations or
attack conditions. The installation commander determines the initial level, based on MOPP
condition analysis, and adjusts levels as mission priorities and intelligence changes. MOPP levels
<!-- Page 327 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
327
are used in conjunction with alarm conditions listed in paragraph 17.6. to quickly increase or
decrease protection against threats. Split MOPP. Split MOPP is a tactic used to divide an installation or operating location into two
or more CBRN zones, rather than having to declare the entire installation contaminated. If
movement or travel between zones is necessary, zone transition points are used to contain
contamination while allowing the movement of people, equipment, and needed supplies in and
out of established zones. 17.8. Individual Protection
Individual protection is comprised of singular use or a combination of individual protective
equipment, vaccinations and prophylaxes, protective shelters, evacuation, relocation, exposure
control, contamination control, and warning and notification systems. Individual protection
measures are taken in stages equivalent to the urgency and nature of the threat. Command and
theater-specific instructions will direct the proper individual protective postures. Ground Crew Ensemble. Regardless of the type of agent, concentration, or method of attack, the best immediate protective equipment against chemical agents is the ground crew ensemble, a
whole-body system which protects the wearer against chemical-biological warfare agents, toxins, and radiological particulates. Individual protection includes a protective mask with filters, overgarment, protective gloves, and footwear covers or overboots. It also includes M8 and M9
detector paper, reactive skin decontamination lotion, and M295 decontamination kits. Knowing
the specific MOPP gear that must be carried and/or worn during the various MOPP levels is
essential to ensuring the best protection possible in all conditions. As depicted by DAF
Emergency Management, Table 17.1. is provided to show appropriate individual protective
postures for MOPP levels. <!-- Page 328 -->

### Personnel Sheltering
All installations are required to conduct threat-based shelter planning. The installation
commander is responsible for establishing a shelter management plan and should designate
responsibility for preparing and operating each shelter during an attack or incident. Shelters are
structures that protect personnel from the effects of CBRN or hazardous material release over
extended periods. Shelter selection is based on structural and personnel housing capabilities in
relation to potential types of disasters. Personnel may be required to shelter-in-place in the event
the type or extent of the hazard is unknown or evacuation at the time would be dangerous. To
ensure the inside of facilities do not become contaminated, occupants will close all windows and
doors, and turn off ventilation systems at the time of the suspected attack. Refer to AFMAN 102502, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures, for shelterin-place and shelter management information. Refer to DAFI 10-2503 for additional information
on wartime sheltering and collective protection. Collective Protection Systems (COLPRO). COLPRO can be a fixed-site or expeditionary
location to provide protection from CBRN agents by utilizing an overpressure system to keep
threat agents outside of certain facilities, ultimately allowing the occupants to work or rest inside
the facility without wearing protective gear. Many of these facilities will have integrated
<!-- Page 329 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
329
contaminated control areas where contaminated personnel are able to enter the facility once
decontaminated and outer garments are removed. 17.10. Critical Resource Protection
Prior to a CBRN attack, every installation must determine which equipment and assets can be
stored, protected, or covered to shield against contamination and damage. Protecting these vital
resources will minimize, or completely remove, the requirement to decontaminate them for
mission use after an attack. To the maximum extent possible, aircraft, support vehicles, aerospace
ground equipment, and munitions should be moved inside or covered. Bulk supplies should be
placed in shelters or under overhead cover. If equipment cannot be placed under overhead cover, it must be covered or wrapped with at least one layer of barrier material to prevent contamination. When possible, use two layers of barrier material to cover the tops of vehicles and equipment. This will serve to ensure contamination can be removed, safely discarded, and replaced, as
necessary. Personnel should be trained and take care when removed barriers to prevent
contamination transfer. <!-- Page 330 -->

### Crisis Response Actions
Crisis response actions during and after a CBRN attack are critical, not only to ensure the DAF
mission is continued, but more importantly, for survival. In threat areas, contamination avoidance
is the key to keeping assets and personnel from becoming contaminated. During attacks, the
primary focus of the base populace should be directed toward force survivability to ensure attack
warning signals and MOPP levels are rapidly disseminated. Typically, the command post will
disseminate attack warning signals, alarm signals, and MOPP levels at the recommendation of
the CBRN Control Center within the EOC. Department of Defense resources, including those associated with military installations located
nearest the scene of an accident or incident, will respond to the event unless otherwise directed
by higher headquarters. Upon witnessing an incident, personnel should alert others in the
immediate area and report the incident to security forces, fire and emergency services, or
installation command and control. After reporting, personnel should stay uphill and upwind; avoid
inhaling fumes, smoke, or vapors; attempt to rescue and care for casualties; avoid handling any
material or component involved in the accident/incident; evacuate the area if rescue or
containment is impractical, or as directed. Note: Every situation is different and should be handled
using established procedures coupled with good judgment. DAF personnel who recognize an
attack in progress should take immediate action regardless of whether or not mass notification has
been disseminated. When alarm red is declared, or attack begins without notification, drop to the
ground, don protective mask (if not donned already), crawl to closest available protection, don
remaining individual protective equipment, and immediately check every member in your
immediate area to make sure they are protected and have donned the proper equipment. Assist
injured and provide self-aid and buddy care with caution to prevent further injuries, particularly
when under fire. Using one’s best judgment is essential regarding seeking immediate cover in
place or crawling immediately to a safe location, particularly when an area becomes increasingly
dangerous. 17.12. Attack Reporting
If an attack or enemy movement is observed, report it up the chain of command immediately. Use
the S-A-L-U-T-E reporting method as shown in Table 17.2. as a quick and effective way to
communicate attack information. S-A-L-U-T-E reports are submitted to the control center or work
center through the most secure means. <!-- Page 331 -->

Table 17.2. SALUTE Reporting
### Recovery Procedures
Recovery actions focuses on saving lives, detecting, and mitigating hazards, mission restoration, and sustainment. Immediate actions are necessary to treat casualties, assess damage, and control
contamination. Minimizing the amount of personnel exposed to post-attack hazards is critical for
mission continuation and force survivability. The recovery concept involves a combined effort
from personnel who are trained to operate as a team and are able to use specialized equipment to
spearhead recovery efforts. Reestablishing the mission is a top priority. Reconnaissance. The installation commander will determine when base specialized and unit
reconnaissance teams begin post-attack CBRN surveys. Control centers will be directed to release
post-attack reconnaissance (PAR) teams to collect information about the effects of the attack. PAR teams or resource owners are responsible for reporting information to their respective control
center as well as marking and reporting contamination and contaminated equipment to ensure
approaching personnel are aware of the hazard associated with the resource. The control center
will forward survey information to the CBRN Control Center within the EOC. Post-Attack Reporting. Effective communication between PAR teams and leadership is
essential. The CBRN Control Center within the EOC is the primary command and control
function for collecting and consolidating post-attack information. The EOC Director up-channels
information and makes recommendations regarding alarm signals and MOPP levels to the CAT
based on the information collected by specialized and PAR teams. Decontamination. For those not on a PAR team, recovery actions include performing immediate
decontamination (if contaminated) and remaining under cover in a safe location unless otherwise
directed. Control centers will assess and determine what methods of decontamination, if any, can
be reasonably put into action. The eyes are very vulnerable when exposed to nerve and blister
agents. If one of these agents gets in the eyes, the eyes should be irrigated with water. If a chemical
agent gets on the skin or protective equipment, it must be removed immediately. The reactive skin
decontamination lotion and M295 individual decontamination kits are the most effective methods
of removing chemical agents. In the absence of an individual decontamination kit, personnel
should contact the CBRN Control Center for recommendations. Note: 5-percent chlorine solution
for equipment and 0.5 percent chlorine solution for skin decontamination should only be used
after consultation from CBRN Defense Specialists as some chemicals react negatively to
chlorine. <!-- Page 332 -->

### USAF Mishap Prevention Program
The DAF safety management system is a mishap prevention framework, mandated by DAFI 91202, The U.S. Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, designed to minimize risk and reduce the
occurrence and cost of injuries, illnesses, fatalities, and property damages. The challenge of
deployments, technologically advanced combat systems, and changing duty requirements
demands strong on-duty mishap prevention programs. Off-duty mishap prevention must also
adapt to meet the challenges posed by motor vehicles, sports and recreation, and other off-duty
activities. DAF leaders implement the safety management system by providing guidance and
goals, establishing safety responsibility and accountability, applying risk management to all
activities, and promoting safety throughout the organization. 17.15. Mishap Defined
A DAF mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in occupational
illnesses, death, or injury to DAF personnel, or damage to Department of Defense (DoD) property. Four categories/classes that distinguish mishap severity are defined here. DAF safety
investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only, not for punitive actions or to establish
financial liability. Class A Mishap. A Class A mishap consists of costs totaling $2,500,000, destruction of a
Department of Defense aircraft, or a fatality or permanent total disability. Class B Mishap. A Class B mishap consists of costs totaling $600,000 or more but less than
$2,500,000, a permanent partial disability, or inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel. Class C Mishap. A Class C mishap consists of costs totaling $60,000 or more but less than
$600,000, or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in one or more days away from work. Class D Mishap. A Class D mishap consists of costs totaling $25,000 or more but less than
$60,000, or a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified as a Class A, B, or C mishap. 17.16. Hazard Reporting
The AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, must be readily available in all work centers. When a
hazard cannot be eliminated immediately, notify the safety office, responsible supervisor, or local
agency by telephone or in person, and submit a hazard report. Individuals will report personal
injury, property damage, and any suspected exposure to hazardous materials as soon as practical, but not to exceed 24 hours. Individuals should immediately report a physical or mental condition
they feel could impact safe job performance. Reports can be submitted anonymously. If a hazard
is eliminated on the spot, no further action is required; however, sharing information with other
units or agencies is recommended to help prevent hazards and deficiencies elsewhere. Hazard Report Investigations. Investigators must respond to reports in writing, within 10 duty
days, addressing the corrective action or plans, and conduct follow-up reviews until the corrective
action is completed. <!-- Page 333 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
333
### USAF Mishap Prevention Program-Safety Organization
All DAF personnel will utilize comprehensive risk management principles, processes, tools, and
techniques to assess and mitigate risk associated with both on- and off-duty activities. An effective
mishap prevention program depends on individuals integrating mishap prevention principles at
every functional level and taking personal and collective responsibility for complying with and
enforcing applicable safety standards. Safety Office. At the installation level, safety staffs, host, and tenant units implement mishap
prevention programs as prescribed by DAFI 91-202 and applicable host tenant support
agreements. The safety office staff consists of career safety professionals who are first-term and
career Airmen trained in the enlisted safety career field (AFSC 1S0X1), as well as DAF civilians. When mishaps occur, the safety staff ensures all mishaps are investigated and reported. With the
assistance of commanders, supervisors, and individuals, the host safety office staff provides
oversight of the installation safety program and provides support and guidance to help eliminate
unsafe acts or conditions. Unit Safety Representative. To ensure each unit is actively engaged in mishap prevention, commanders will implement safety and health programs and appoint a primary and alternate unit
safety representative to assist them in implementing their safety programs, to include procurement
and proper use of personal protective equipment, and worker/facility compliance with applicable
standards. Roles built into unit safety programs include using risk management techniques to
analyze work environments and job tasks for hazards; developing work-center-specific job safety
training outlines on safety, fire prevention, protection, and health requirements; and monthly spot
inspections of the work areas. Individuals. All individuals hold a vital role in preventing mishaps. A failure to intervene when
a potential unsafe act is identified is a failure to protect. Every DAF member is accountable for
considering their personal safety and the safety of others when participating in on- and off-duty
activities. Individuals are responsible for complying with all safety instructions, technical orders, job guides, and operating procedures. They identify and report hazardous conditions that place
DAF personnel or property at risk to supervision and/or submit the hazard using the AF Form
## Air Force Safety Center. As a key component of the DAF Mishap Prevention Program, the Air
Force Safety Center works to ensure a safe environment and a safety mindset for all Airmen and
Guardians. The Chief of Safety, who also holds the title of Commander, Air Force Safety Center, heads the organization and is located at the Pentagon with the Deputy Chief of Safety and support
staff. The Air Force Safety Center is composed of the Vice Commander and 10 divisions at
Kirtland Air Force Base. There are several agencies directly linked to the Air Force Safety Center
that have specialized areas of responsibility with regard to ensuring and maintaining safety in the
DAF. Analysis and Cyberspace Operations Division. The Analysis and Cyberspace Operations
Division mission is to leverage information technology, in a cost effective manner, to support the
safety mission for the Air and Space Forces. The division develops and sustains the unique safety
reporting system called the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) which collects and

### Risk Management Decision-Making Process
Risk management is a decision-making process designed to systematically evaluate possible
courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given
situation. Risk management enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and
individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks through a simple, systematic process for
all personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty situations. Appropriate use of risk
management increases an organization’s and individual’s ability to safely and effectively
accomplish their mission while preserving lives and resources. Safety Training. One of the greatest influences of successful mission accomplishment, and a key
aspect of risk management, is a highly trained workforce that recognizes the importance of safety
precautions and procedures and adheres to standards incorporating the basic elements of risk
management. Safety training may be integrated into task performance training or conducted
separately. Job Safety Analysis. A job safety analysis is used to evaluate each work task not governed by a
technical order or other definitive guidance and when a new work task or process is introduced
into the workplace. Supervisors are responsible for training, establishing work methods and job
instructions, assigning jobs, and supervising personnel. Before any operation begins and any
safety training can take place, supervisors must determine where people may be injured, or
equipment may be damaged. They are in the best position to identify hazards, assess risks
associated with those hazards, and correct unsafe work practices or safety deficiencies that would
impede mission success. 17.19. Risk Management Principles
Four principles govern all actions associated with risk management. These principles are the
cornerstones of effective risk management and are applicable 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, 365days a year by all personnel, for all on- and off-duty activities. Accept No Unnecessary Risk. All DAF missions and daily routines involve risk. However, unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate return in terms of real benefits or available
opportunities. The most logical choices or actions are those that meet all mission requirements
while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk possible. With this in mind, we cannot and should not be completely risk averse. Even high risk endeavors may be undertaken
when there is a well-founded basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the
costs. Balancing benefits and costs are a subjective process and tied intimately with the factors
affecting the mission or activity. Personnel with prior knowledge and experience of a mission or
activity must be engaged whenever possible in making risk decisions to ensure a proper balance
is achieved. Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level. Although anyone can make a risk decision that
impacts their personal well-being, some risk acceptance decisions must be made by an appropriate
decision-making authority to effectively allocate resources and implement controls to mitigate or
eliminate risks associated with an activity. Making risk decisions at the appropriate level also
establishes clear accountability. Leaders and individuals must be aware of how much risk they
can accept and when to elevate risk management decisions to a higher level. Those accountable
<!-- Page 337 -->

337
for the success or failure of a mission or activity must be fully engaged in the risk decision process. Integrate Risk Management into Operations and Planning at All Levels. Integrate risk
management into planning at all levels and as early as possible. This provides the greatest
opportunity to make informed risk decisions and implement effective risk controls. To effectively
apply risk management, commanders, supervisors, and personnel must dedicate time and
resources to integrate risk management principles into planning, operational processes, and dayto-day activities. Risk assessments of operations and activities are most successful when
incorporated deliberately in the normal sequence of events (the pre-planning of a mission or
activity) by individuals directly involved in the event, and not as a last minute or add-on process. Risk management planning, even in a time-constrained environment, is better than no planning at
all. Apply the Risk Management Process Cyclically and Continuously. Risk management is a
continuous process applied across the full spectrum of military training and operations, base
operations functions, and day-to-day activities and events both on- and off-duty. This cyclic
process is used to continuously identify and assess hazards, develop, and implement controls, evaluate outcomes, and provide feedback to our Airmen and Guardians to save lives and preserve
combat resources. 17.20. Risk Management Levels
The principles, goals, and fundamental concepts of risk management highlight the universal
application of risk management both on- and off-duty. There are two primary levels of risk
management: deliberate and real-time. Deliberate and real-time risk management are interrelated
when making risk management decisions. They are separated only at the point where planning
transitions to execution of the mission or activity. A strong, effective risk management process
involves careful deliberative planning coupled with effective real-time risk management. This
dual approach ensures comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood of mission or activity
success. Deliberate Risk Management. Deliberate risk management may involve the full, formal
application of the complete five-step risk management process, ranging from thorough hazard
identification, detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal testing, and long-term
tracking of the risks associated with an operation, activity, or system. Deliberate risk management
may simply involve normal day-to-day operations or activity planning that utilize the same fivestep risk management process but require less time and resources to complete. In-Depth Risk Management Planning. Another aspect of deliberate risk management that is
generally associated with strategic-level planning is referred to as in-depth risk management
planning. It is reserved for complex operations and systems, as well as high priority and high
visibility situations or circumstances in which hazards are not well understood or easily
predictable. In-depth risk management is normally implemented well in advance of a planned
system, mission, event, or activity, and is normally reserved for more complex and risky efforts, such as large troop movements, airshow planning, or tactics and training curricula development. 17.21. Five-Step Risk Management Process
Risk management is a continuous, systematic decision process consisting of five steps primarily
associated with deliberate risk management planning that forms the basis for real-time risk
management process considerations. The following is a brief description of the Five-Step Risk
Management Process and is illustrated in Figure 17.1.: <!-- Page 338 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
338
Step 1. Identify the Hazards. Step 1 of the
Five-Step Risk Management Process is to
identify the hazards. Identifying the hazards
involves application of appropriate hazard
identification techniques to identify hazards
associated with
the operation or activity. Hazards can be defined as any real or potential
condition that can cause mission degradation, injury, illness, death to personnel, or damage to
or loss of equipment or property. Implementing
Step 1 includes (1) reviewing current and
planned operations and tasks associated with the
mission or activity, (2) identifying and listing
hazards and factors that may lead to dangers and
risks associated with the operation or activity, and (3) listing the causes associated with each
identified hazard and trying to identify the root
cause against which to apply risk management strategies. Figure 17.1. 5-Step Risk Management Process
Step 2. Assess the Hazards. Step 2 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is to assess the
hazards. Assessing the hazards involves the application of quantitative or qualitative measures to
determine the probability and severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to risks
or hazards and directly affect mission or activity success. Implementing Step 2 includes: (1)
evaluating the time, proximity, volume, or repetition involved to determine the level of exposure
to hazards; (2) determining severity of the hazard in terms of potential impact on personnel, equipment, or mission/activity; (3) determining the probability that the hazard will cause a
negative event of the severity assessed above (probability may be determined through estimates
or actual numbers); and (4) determining the level of risk associated with the hazard as related to
severity and probability. Associated with Step 2 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is a risk assessment matrix
that can be used to form a risk assessment for each hazard by combining the probability of
occurrence with severity. Risk levels will vary from “extremely high” as associated with frequent
exposure and catastrophic effects to “low” as associated with unlikely exposure and negligible
effects. A complete and in-depth description of the risk assessment matrix can be found in
DAFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools. Step 3. Develop Controls and Make Decisions. Step 3 of the Five-Step Risk Management
Process is to develop controls and make decisions. This step involves the development and
selection of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation
measures reduce one of the three components (probability, severity, or exposure) of risk. There is
no “cookie-cutter” approach or specific standard for establishing levels of risk management
decision authority across the DAF. The higher the risk, the higher the decision level needs to be
to ensure an appropriate analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. It is
critical that leaders and decision-makers ensure the levels of decision authority are aligned
appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the personnel conducting
operations/activities under their responsibility. Implementing Step 3 includes: (1) starting with the highest-risk hazards as assessed in Step 2, and
identifying as many risk control options for each hazard as possible that can effectively eliminate, avoid, or reduce the risk to an acceptable level; (2) determining the effect of each control on the
<!-- Page 339 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
339
risk(s) associated with the hazard; (3) prioritizing risk controls for each hazard that will reduce
the risk to an acceptable level within mission objectives, and optimize use of available resources
(manpower, materiel, equipment, funding, and time); (4) selecting those risk controls that will
reduce the risk to an acceptable level consistent with mission or activity objectives and optimum
use of available resources; and (5) analyzing the level of risk for the operation or activity with the
proposed controls in place, and determining if the benefits now exceed the level of risk the
operation or activity presents. Step 4. Implement Controls. Step 4 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is to implement
controls. Once control measures have been selected, an implementation strategy must be
developed and carried out. The strategy must identify who, what, when, where, and how much
cost is associated with the control measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be
emphasized across all levels of leadership and personnel associated with the action so there is a
clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of commanders and subordinates alike. There
must always be accountability for acceptance of risk regardless of circumstances. Implementing
Step 4 includes: (1) providing a roadmap for implementation, a vision of the end state, and a
description of successful implementation; (2) establishing accountability for making the decision
and determining who is responsible at the unit or execution level for implementation of the risk
control; and (3) providing the personnel and resources necessary to implement the control
measures. Incorporate sustainability from the beginning and be sure to deploy the control measure
along with a feedback mechanism that will provide information on whether the control measure
is achieving the intended purpose. Step 5. Supervise and Evaluate. Step 5 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is to
supervise and evaluate. Leaders and supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles
to ensure controls are sustained over time. Implementing Step 5 includes: (1) supervising and
monitoring the operation or activity, and (2) reviewing and evaluating to ensure risk and cost are
in balance. Significant changes in the system are recognized and appropriate risk management
controls are reapplied, as necessary, to control the risks. Effective review and evaluation will also
identify whether actual costs are in line with expectations and how the controls have affected
mission performance (good or bad). Note: When risk analysis contains errors, it is important for
those errors to be identified and corrected. Also, after-action reports, surveys, and in-progress
reviews are excellent tools for measurements. A feedback system must be established to ensure
that the corrective or preventative action taken was effective and that any newly discovered
hazards identified are analyzed and subsequent corrective action taken. 17.22. Real-Time RM
Real-Time Risk Management is a less formal risk assessment using basic RM process steps to
identify and mitigate hazards in a new or changing situation. Although Real-Time Risk
Management is founded on the 5-Step RM Process, streamlining the steps is essential in situations
where risk decisions need to be made quickly and in Real-Time. Identifying and Assessing Hazards. Identifying and assessing hazards in a time-critical
environment typically occurs when a planned activity is already underway or when the complexity
or perception of overall risk is low. Effective identification and assessment requires the key
elements of hazard and risk identification and understanding the negative effects associated with
those hazards and risks. It is essential for individuals to seriously consider the activity or action
in which they are about to engage and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to address the
hazards they identify. In Real-Time Risk Management, a complete assessment of the situation
requires three stages of situational awareness in a relatively short time: (a) Perception of what is
happening, (b) Integration of information and goals, and (c) Projection into the future. Unlike
<!-- Page 340 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
340
Deliberate RM, where there is ample time to assess potential situations, it is an individual’s ability
to discern the situation and apply available resources quickly and effectively that can mean the
difference between success or failure. Developing Controls. After assessing the situation, personnel must consider all available controls
(resources) to facilitate mission or activity success and how to manage them effectively. Controls
and resources can vary in scope and availability from situation to situation. The better prepared
individuals are prior to an activity, the more likely they will have more controls and resources
available to create multiple redundancies or “blocks” to effectively eliminate or mitigate potential
risks in real-time. Examples include having a good understanding of the situation, being properly
trained, wearing correct personal protective equipment, knowing personal limitations, and having
a “Wingman” to support their effort(s). Each of these controls and resources serves as a layer of
protection and enhances a decision maker’s ability to effectively balance risk versus reward
through proper preparation and understanding of the situation and options. When making these
considerations it is also essential that Airmen and Guardians communicate with their team and
leadership to ensure all options and resources are effectively utilized in making a sound yet timely
risk decision. Communicating. Communication can take various forms such as real-time communication with
leadership to discuss problems and intentions, internal team and crew communication can address
real-time hazards and mitigation options, or an individual internalizing their current situation and
taking time to evaluate if they are heading down the right path. This action assumes individuals
or teams carefully consider options and controls available to them in real-time situations. They
should be aware of how perception and communication skills change in unanticipated and
changing environments. Perception and communication skills are adversely affected as individuals become increasingly
stressed and lose situational awareness. Feeling undue pressure to succeed or to continue with a
plan when anticipated conditions require “mid-stream” changes can have similar effects on
individuals or team members as they try to compensate. In these high stress situations, communication skills diminish as individuals channelize attention and lose awareness of the
overall situation. They can experience tunnel vision and be unable to multitask effectively to deal
with the changing circumstances. Understanding this, individuals and teams thrust into these situations can better prepare, anticipate, and identify if they or others are losing situational awareness and make corrections. This awareness enables individuals to more effectively communicate with teammates and
leadership in Real-Time situations. It allows them to take a step back and reevaluate options. Asking questions such as: “Who needs to know about the situation?” “Who can help or assist?”
“Who can provide back-up?” or “Can this be done differently” are just a few examples of the
considerations that must be made prior to implementing a mitigation strategy in Real-Time. Making Decisions. Unlike the deliberative RM level where an implementation strategy is
carefully developed and carried out through identification of the who, what, when, where and cost
associated with the control prior to an activity, Real-Time Risk Management relies on the
individual or small group taking immediate or near immediate action to mitigate risk(s) in RealTime. This aspect alone can make Real-Time Risk Management decisions riskier than deliberate
RM decisions. Individuals must realize this and make every effort to deliberately weigh risk
decisions before taking action to ensure they are selecting the best course of action. Implementing Controls. Sometimes the original plan must be modified or changed to account
for unforeseen issues in order to assure success. Although minor changes or modifications to a
<!-- Page 341 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
341
plan or strategy may be easily implemented, others may require higher authority (if available) to
properly weigh the risk and determine the best course of action. Accountability under these
circumstances rests solely with the individual(s) involved in the activity. It is their responsibility
to fully understand the scope and limits of their Go/No-Go decision and act accordingly. As such, the acceptance of risk and associated consequences needs to be taken seriously with the
understanding that any adverse outcome from a selected course of action may not only affect the
individual, but greatly impact family, friends, coworkers, and the individual’s ability to contribute
to the DAF mission. The goal for any mission or activity is to operate safely and achieve success. However, all Airmen
and Guardians must consider the possibility of abandoning the mission or activity if the situation
appears too risky or too costly to continue. Particularly when there are no reasonable options or
strategies to change or alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the mission or
activity. Supervising and Evaluating. It is essential that both leadership and personnel involved in a
mission or activity ensure that the feedback loop or “Evaluate” aspect of the RM process is
performed. This vital process step ensures individuals follow through and complete the 5-Step
process by identifying what worked, what did not work, and ensures documented lessons learned
are disseminated. Debriefs will improve performance, mitigate risks in future activities, and are
essential in completing the RM 5-Step process. Asking questions such as: “Was our assessment
accurate?” “Were we lucky?” “How well did we use the controls and resources?” “Was the
communication effective?” and “What can we do to improve the events in the future?” are a few
examples of questions that leaders, crews and teams, and individuals can ask in debriefs to ensure
future activities are improved and risks are reduced. Knock-it-off and Timeout Concepts. Integral to Real-Time Risk Management are the concepts
of "Knock-it-off" and "Timeout" during an ongoing operation or activity. These concepts are
essential to ensuring that all personnel have a voice in any situation to identify concerns or to
inform others of a developing hazardous situation. Verbalizing either of these terms sends a
message to those involved in a specific action to stop, take a moment to reset, and reevaluate the
current situation. The terms should be integrated as an essential part of all on- and off-duty
operations and activities. Key aspects of these two terms include: All Airmen and Guardians (regardless of rank or position) are empowered to use these terms
without any fear of repercussions. When either term is used, all current actions are immediately halted, and the situation is stabilized
to a safe position in order to evaluate what the specific concern is; this is nonnegotiable and cannot
be overridden by command authority. After the Knock-it-off or Timeout call, a clear determination is made whether the current action
may be continued safely, requires change, or must be terminated based upon the perceived
concern(s) or hazard(s). The alerts provided by the use of those terms do not prevent actions from continuing, once safety
and risk concerns are addressed, but provide all personnel with an avenue to effectively mitigate
risk through immediate intervention in any evolving operation or activity.
