### Enlisted Promotion Systems
The enlisted promotion system supports DoD Directive 1304.20, Enlisted Personnel Management
System (EPMS), by providing visible, relatively stable career progression opportunities; attracting, retaining, and motivating the people the military needs; and ensuring a uniform application of the
principle of equal pay for equal work among the services. While many significant changes have
taken place with the enlisted promotion systems in recent years, there are some standardized, consistent aspects that Airmen recognize and rely on for fair and accurate consideration for
promotion. AFI 36-2502, Enlisted Airman Promotion and Demotion Programs, provides detailed
information regarding enlisted promotion systems. Note: This chapter applies to RegAF enlisted
promotions. 9.2. Promotion Quotas
The Department of Defense limits the number of Airmen the RegAF may have in the top five
enlisted grades. Promotion quotas for Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant are tied to
fiscal year-end strength and are affected by funding limits, regulatory limits, and the number of
projected vacancies in specific grades. Public law, as outlined in Title 10, U.S.C., Armed Forces, Chapter 36, Promotion, Separation, and Involuntary Retirement of Officers on the Active Duty
List, limits the number of Airmen who may serve in the RegAF in the top two enlisted grades. The
authorized average of enlisted members on RegAF status (other than for training) in pay grades E8 and E-9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 2.5 percent and 1.25 percent, respectively. 9.3. Enlisted Promotion Opportunities
While the USAF promotion system is designed to promote eligible Airmen recommended by their
commander on a noncompetitive basis, there are additional opportunities and factors for Airmen
to consider regarding promotions. Senior Airman Below-the-Zone Promotion Program. Under the Senior Airman Below-theZone Program, Airmen in the grade of Airman First Class may be considered one time for early
advancement to Senior Airman if they meet the minimum eligibility criteria. If promoted to Senior
Airman below-the-zone, the promotion effective date is six months before their fully qualified date. Airmen are considered for below-the-zone promotion in the month (December, March, June, or
September) before the quarter (January - March, April - June, July - September, or October -
December) that they are eligible. Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program. The Stripes for Exceptional Performers (STEP)
Program is designed to meet those unique circumstances that, in a commander’s judgment, clearly
warrant promotion. The STEP Program is intended to promote Airmen for compelling, although
perhaps not quantifiable, reasons. Isolated acts or specific achievements should not be the sole
basis for promotion under this program. Under the STEP Program, commanders at various organizational levels may promote a limited
number of exemplary performing Airmen with exceptional potential to the ranks of Staff Sergeant
and Technical Sergeant. An individual may not receive more than one promotion under any

combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period. One exception is that Senior
Airmen must serve six months of time in grade before being promoted to Staff Sergeant. Commanders must ensure personnel who are promoted meet eligibility requirements. Weighted Airman Promotion System. NCOs and SNCOs compete for promotion and test under
the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) in the control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC)
held on the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Contributing factors are “weighted” or assigned
points based on the importance relative to promotion. The Promotion Fitness Exam (PFE) contains
a wide range of USAF knowledge, while the Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) covers AFSC broad
technical knowledge. The USAF makes promotion selections under the WAPS within each AFSC, not across all AFSCs. This means those who are eligible will compete for promotion with those
individuals currently working in their AFSC. Selectees are individuals with the highest scores in
each AFSC, within the quota limitations. If more than one individual has the same total score at
the cutoff point, the USAF promotes everyone with that score. Senior Noncommissioned Officer Promotions. Airmen compete, and are selected for
AF specialty code as of promotion eligibility cutoff date. Individuals with a reporting indicator or
special duty indicator designated as their control AF specialty code on the promotion eligibility
cutoff date will compete within that reporting indicator or special duty indicator. SNCO
promotions are accomplished via a central board. In-System Supplemental Promotion Process. The in-system supplemental action is typically
processed on a monthly basis. Eligible Staff Sergeants through Senior Master Sergeants whose
weighable data changes in their promotion file compete monthly for promotion consideration. Insystem supplemental consideration also applies to Airmen who test after initial selects have been
made, such as deployed Airmen, or anyone who was unable to test during their normal testing
window. Senior Noncommissioned Officer Supplemental Promotion Process. The SNCO supplemental
board is for those members promotion-eligible to Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, or
Chief Master Sergeant. Supplemental evaluation boards are conducted on a semiannual basis. SNCOs may request to meet the supplemental board if they believe they have a valid request. With
the exception of a missing static closeout date evaluation, there are no automatic approvals for
supplemental board consideration when a record did not meet a previous board for which they
were eligible. Supplemental promotion consideration may not be granted if an error or omission
appeared on the data verification record or in the SNCO selection record located in the personnel
records display application, and the individual did not take the necessary steps to correct the error
prior to promotion selection or prior to the evaluation board. Fully documented supplemental
consideration requests, to include proof of corrective or follow-up actions taken by the individual
to correct the error, are submitted to the military personnel flight in writing with the
recommendation of the individual’s unit commander. The military personnel flight forwards the
request to Air Force Personnel Center for final approval. <!-- Page 173 -->

## Section 9B — Promotion Cycles B B C C C

### Promotion Cycles and Eligibility
The USAF establishes promotion cycles to ensure timely periodic promotions and to permit
accurate forecasting of vacancies. Promotion cycles also balance the promotion administrative
workload and provide promotion eligibility cutoff dates (PECD). Factors for promotion eligibility
may include proper skill level, sufficient time in grade, sufficient time in service, commander
recommendation, completion of enlisted professional military education (PME), completion of a
college degree, cumulative years of enlisted service, and high year of tenure. Note: Air Reserve
Components promotions are based on a combination of position vacancy, time-in-grade, time-inservice, fitness, and completion of appropriate professional military education. 9.5. Basic Promotion Guidelines
The basic promotion guidelines for enlisted members are provided here. Promotion to Airman. Airman Basic may be promotion eligible to Airman at six months of time
in grade. Promotion to Airman First Class. Airman may be promotion eligible to Airman First Class at
## months of time in grade. Airmen initially enlisting for a period of six years are promoted from
Airman Basic to Airman First Class upon completion of either technical training or 20 weeks of
technical training after graduation from basic military training (whichever occurs first). The date
of rank for Airman First Class is then adjusted to the signatory date on the basic military training
certificate, without back pay and allowances. Promotion to Senior Airman. Airmen may be promotion eligible to Senior Airman upon
completion of 36 months of time in service and 20 months of time in grade or 28 months of time
in grade (whichever occurs first). Required skill level in primary AFSC is 3-level. Senior Airman
below-the-zone is a one-time promotion consideration to advance to Senior Airman six months
earlier than basic promotion timelines to Senior Airman. Promotion to Staff Sergeant. Senior Airmen may be promotion eligible to Staff Sergeant upon
completion of three years of time in service and six months of time in grade. The PECD for
promotion to Staff Sergeant is 31 March. The test cycle is May – June. Required skill level in
primary AFSC is 5-level. Promotion to Technical Sergeant. Staff Sergeants may be promotion eligible to Technical
Sergeant upon completion of five years of time in service and 23 months of time in grade. The
PECD for promotion to Technical Sergeant is 31 January. The test cycle is February – March. Required skill level in primary AFSC is 7-level. Promotion to Master Sergeant. Technical Sergeants may be promotion eligible to Master
Sergeant upon completion of eight years of time in service and 24 months of time in grade. The
PECD for promotion to Master Sergeant is 30 November. Required skill level in primary AFSC is
7-level. Promotion to Senior Master Sergeant. Master Sergeants may be promotion eligible to Senior
Master Sergeant upon completion of 11 years of time in service and 20 months of time in grade. The PECD for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant is 30 September. Required skill level in
primary AFSC is 7-level. <!-- Page 174 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
174
Promotion to Chief Master Sergeant. Senior Master Sergeants may be promotion eligible to
Chief Master Sergeant upon completion of 14 years of time in service and 21 months of time in
grade. The PECD for promotion to Chief Master Sergeant is 31 July. Required skill level in primary
AFSC is 9-level. 9.6. Accepting Promotion
Selects to the grade of Master Sergeant and Senior Master Sergeant with more than 18 years Total
Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) by effective date of promotion will sign a Promotion
Statement of Understanding within 10 duty days after selections are confirmed. In addition, all
Chief Master Sergeant-selects, regardless of TAFMS, will sign a Promotion Statement of
Understanding within 10 duty days after selections are confirmed. The form will acknowledge that
Master Sergeant-selects and Senior Master Sergeant-selects must obtain two years of service
retainability and incur a two-year active duty service commitment (ADSC) from the effective date
of promotion. Chief Master Sergeant-selects must acknowledge and obtain three years of service
retainability and incur a three-year ADSC from the effective date of promotion. Failure to
withdraw an existing retirement application (approved or pending) within 10 duty days from
presentation of the Promotion Statement of Understanding will result in removal from the selection
list. 9.7. Promotion Sequence Numbers
The Air Force Personnel Center assigns promotion sequence numbers to Airmen selected for
promotion to Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant based on date of rank, TAFMS, and
date of birth. Supplemental selectees are assigned promotion sequence numbers of.9 (increment
previously announced) or.5 (unannounced future increment). 9.8. Declining Promotion
Airmen may decline a promotion in writing by submitting a letter to the military personnel flight
(MPF). This may be accomplished any time prior to the promotion effective date. The declination
letter must include name, social security number, promotion cycle, promotion sequence number if
already selected, and a statement of understanding that reinstatement will not be authorized. MPF
will ensure Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) is updated and forwards a copy of the
declination letter to AFPC to be filed in the member’s Automated Records Management System
(ARMS). 9.9. Promotion Ineligibility
There are many reasons why an Airman may be considered ineligible for promotion, such as
approved retirement, declination for extension or reenlistment, court-martial conviction, control
roster action, no commander recommendation, failure to appear for scheduled testing without a
valid reason and absent without leave. When individuals are ineligible for promotion, they cannot
test, cannot be considered if already tested, and the projected promotion, if already selected, will
be canceled. <!-- Page 175 -->

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**

Chapter 9—ENLISTED PROMOTIONS SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
## Section 9C — Preparation and Responsibilities B B C C C

### Individual Responsibilities
Preparing for promotion testing is an individual responsibility. All promotion eligible individuals
must know their eligibility status, maintain specialty and military qualifications, initiate a selfstudy plan, obtain all applicable study references as outlined in the Enlisted Promotions References
and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC), ensure their selection folder is accurate if it will be reviewed
by the central evaluation board, and be prepared to test on the beginning of the testing window. The importance of individual responsibility cannot be overemphasized. Members who will be
unavailable during the entire testing cycle must be prepared to test prior to their departure, even if
that is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airmen may opt to test early provided the correct
test booklets are available. 9.11. Enlisted Promotion Test Compromise
Airmen must use a self-initiated program of individual study and effort under the Weighted Airman
Promotion System (WAPS). Group study (two or more people) for the purposes of enlisted
promotion testing is strictly prohibited. This prohibition protects the integrity of the promotion
testing program by ensuring promotion test scores are a reflection of each member’s individual
knowledge. Enlisted personnel who violate these prohibitions are subject to prosecution under
Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for violating a lawful general regulation. Conviction can result in a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and
confinement for up to two years. Information concerning enlisted promotion test compromise is
contained in DAFMAN 36-2664. Note: Training designed to improve general military knowledge
does not constitute group study as long as the intent of the training is not to study for promotion
tests. Likewise, training to improve general study habits or test-taking skills is permissible if the
training does not focus on preparing for promotion tests. Restrictions on Group Study. Restrictions on group study and additional specific test
compromise situations regarding promotion tests are briefly covered here. Discussing promotion test content with anyone other than the test control officer or test
examiner is prohibited. Written inquiries or complaints about a test are handled by the test
control officer. Sharing pretests or lists of test questions recalled from a current or previous promotion test; personal study materials; underlined or highlighted study reference material; and commercial
study guides with other individuals is prohibited. Placing commercial study guide software on government computers is prohibited. While
Airmen may use commercial study materials in preparation for promotion testing, the USAF
does not recommend, endorse, or support commercial study guides. Creating, storing, or transferring personal study notes on government computers is prohibited. Government computers may only be used to view electronic versions of official study
references. <!-- Page 176 -->

### Distribution of Enlisted Promotion Test Study References
The Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, Air Force Career Development Academy is responsible
for providing promotion eligible members access to WAPS Career Development Courses. They
the USAF Enlisted Promotion Study Guides website
are available on-line at
(https://www.studyguides.af.mil/). The site is updated to coincide with release of the EPRRC. Study materials, such as instructions, manuals, or technical orders, are made available online at the
Air Force Departmental Publishing Office website (https://www.e-publishing.af.mil/) or other
approved repositories. Individuals may ask unit WAPS monitors to order study reference material
listed in the catalog that is not locally available. According to DAFMAN 36-2664, promotion
eligible Airmen must have access to reference materials at least 60 days before the scheduled test
date. If not, the Airman may request a delay in testing. 9.13. Promotion Eligibility Cutoff Date
The promotion eligibility cutoff date (PECD) is used to determine Airman promotion eligibility as
well as the cutoff date that will determine when contents of the selection folder and information
on promotion evaluation briefs must be updated and complete. The PECD is the date that
promotion criteria are considered for promotion, such as the data provided on the Data Verification
Brief, that is used for promotion board evaluation consideration. For SNCOs, this information is
then used to post the SNCO evaluation brief filed in the SNCO selection folder. Promotion Criteria. As the USAF continues to offer opportunities for career broadening and
special duty assignments, it is important to mention that individuals with a reporting identifier or
special duty identifier, designated as their control AFSC on the PECD, will compete within that
reporting identifier or special duty identifier. Otherwise, Master Sergeants being considered for
promotion to Senior Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the superintendent level of the
control AFSC they held as of the PECD. Likewise, Senior Master Sergeants being considered for
promotion to Chief Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the chief enlisted manager code
of the control AFSC they held as of the PECD. 9.14. Data Verification Record
The Data Verification Record (DVR) is the document utilized for promotion consideration and is
the most important tool to review to ensure information on a promotion record is complete. All
eligible Airmen must review their DVR in the Automated Records Management System/Personnel
Records Display Application (ARMS/PRDA). If an error or omission is noted, the Airman must
immediately contact his or her military personnel flight for assistance. The military personnel flight
will update the Military Personnel Data System with the correct data and update the DVR on virtual
military personnel flight. Airmen should review the updated record to verify changes have been
completed accurately. Data reflected on the DVR should not be confused with the Data Verification
Brief or a Single Unit Retrieval Format, commonly referred to as SURF. Data Verification Record Review Steps: Access the USAF Portal
Access PRDA
Under My Sections, select PRDA
The Selection Folder category within PRDA is the “As Is” record
The Board category within PRDA is the “As Met” record

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**

Chapter 9—ENLISTED PROMOTIONS SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
## Section 9D — Promotion Testing B B C C C

### Promotion Test Development
Air Education and Training Command, Studies and Analysis Squadron, Airman Advancement
Section, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, produces all USAF enlisted promotion tests, which are written by Airmen for Airmen. Teams of SNCOs travel to work in-house with test
development specialists and apply their knowledge and expertise to develop current, relevant, and
accurate test questions for enlisted promotion testing. At the beginning of a test development
project, the most current tests are administered to the test development teams. This gives test
writers the point of view of the test takers and helps them evaluate how the test content relates to
performance in their specialties. Teams will also carefully check the references of each question
for currency and accuracy. Only after this is accomplished do the teams begin developing new
test questions. During test development, test development specialists provide psychometric and
developmental expertise required to ensure the tests are credible, valid, and fair to all examinees. Promotion Fitness Examination. The Promotion Fitness Examinations (PFE) measure military
and supervisory knowledge required of Staff Sergeants and Technical Sergeants. For the PFE, test
development specialists select Chief Master Sergeants based on their extensive experience and
major command representation to develop and validate questions. Specialty Knowledge Tests. Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) measure important job knowledge
required in a particular specialty. For SKTs, test development specialists work closely with USAF
career field managers to stay abreast of changes affecting career fields which may impact
promotion test development. SNCOs, based on their specialties and job experiences, are selected
to develop, and validate SKT questions. Resources used to develop SKTs include Career Field
Education and Training Plans, occupational analysis data, and experiences to ensure test content
is related to important tasks performed in the specialty. 9.16. Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog
Published annually on 1 October, the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog
(EPRRC), lists all enlisted promotion tests authorized for administration and the study references
associated with these tests. Every question on a promotion test comes from one of the publications
listed in the EPRRC, and only publications used to support questions on a given promotion test
are listed. The study references for the PFE are the grade-specific Enlisted Promotion Study Guides
derived from AFH 1. The study references for SKTs are often a combination of Career
Development Courses and technical references. Career Development Courses used as study
references may be different from those issued for upgrade training. The catalog also contains
administrative and special instructions for test control officers. The EPRRC is available at the
USAF Enlisted Promotion Study Guides website (https://www.studyguides.af.mil/). 9.17. Promotion Test Administration and Scoring
Promotion tests are administered electronically to all Airmen competing for promotion to the
grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant. Test administration procedures are
standardized to ensure fairness for all members competing for promotion. All promotion tests are
electronically scored at HQ AETC SAS following thorough quality control steps to ensure
accurate test results are recorded for each member. In some cases when a paper copy of the tests
is administered, strict procedures are used for handling, storing, and transmitting paper copy test
<!-- Page 178 -->

booklets and answer sheets at all times. These instances are the exception to electronic test
administration and must be approved by the Air Force Personnel Center. For these tests, scanning
and scoring process contains many safeguards to verify accuracy which is conducted at the Air
Force Personnel Center. Test Scores. A minimum score of 40 points is required on a PFE. A minimum score of 40 points
is required on a SKT. A combined score of 90 points is required. Airmen who score the minimum
## points on either exam (when taking both examinations) must score a minimum 50 on the other
one to meet the minimum combined score of 90. For those testing PFE only, a minimum score of
## is required (combined score of 90 when doubled). 9.18. Promotion Points
Calculating points for promotion can be a somewhat complex, but not complicated process. The
complete charts, to include exceptions and notes for calculating points and factors for promotion, are included in AFI 36-2502. <!-- Page 179 -->

## Section 9E — Evaluation Boards

**REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION**

Chapter 9—ENLISTED PROMOTIONS SSgt TSgt MSgt SMSgt CMSgt
## Section 9E — Evaluation Boards B B C C C

### Promotion Evaluation Boards
The promotion evaluation board is very important because it accounts for over half the total
promotion score points. Understanding how board members are selected, the evaluation board
process, and those areas considered by board members, can provide valuable insight into what is
required to get promoted. Selection of Board Members. The number of promotion eligible personnel, identified by major
commands and Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC), determines the career field backgrounds of
board members. Board members are divided into panels, each consisting of one Colonel and two
Chief Master Sergeants. The board president is always a General Officer. Before evaluating
records, board members are briefed and sworn to complete the board’s task impartially. They also
participate in an extensive trial-run process to ensure scoring consistency before evaluating any
“live” records. 9.20. Evaluation Board Process
The evaluation board looks at several areas regarding an Airman’s career, which may include
performance, education, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements, and leadership. A number of factors affect board scores from year to year—
new panel members with different thought processes, changed or improved records, and a pool of
new eligibles. As a result, board scores do vary (often significantly) from one board to the next. While scores will vary between panels, all records within a Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Code
or AFSC are evaluated under the same standard. The important aspect of a final board score is how
one eligible compares to his or her peers in the final order of merit. Board members do not have
access to the weighted scores of individuals competing for promotion. When board members
disband, they do not know who was selected. Trial Run. Board members are given two selected sets of records to score as a practice exercise
using secret ballots before the actual board scoring process begins. This trial run helps establish a
scoring standard that can be applied consistently across the board. Each board arrives at their own
scoring standard. Everyone competing in a CEM Code or AFSC is looked at under the same
standard to ensure fair and equitable consideration is applied. Scoring. After the trial run is completed and discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of live
records. The same panel evaluates all eligibles competing in a CEM Code or AFSC. Each panel
member scores each record, using a 6- to 10-point scale and half-point increments. An individual’s
record may receive a panel composite score (three members) from a minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a
maximum of 30 (10-10-10) points. The composite score (18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by a
factor of 15, resulting in a total board score (270 to 450). Using a secret ballot, panel members
score the record individually with no discussion. Records are given to each panel member, and
after they are scored, the ballots are given directly to a recorder. This ensures each panel member
has scored each record independently. Scoring Resolution. A record scored with a difference of more than one point between any of the
panel members (for example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is termed a split vote and is returned to the panel
for resolution. At this time, all panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. This allows them to state why they scored the record as they did. Only those panel members
<!-- Page 180 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
180
directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel members cannot come to an
agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board president for resolution. This ensures
consistency of scoring and eliminates the possibility that one panel member will have a major
impact (positive or negative) on an individual’s board score. Post-Board Processing. After the board is finished, the weighted factor scores are combined with
the board scores. This completely electronic operation builds an order of merit listing by total score
within each CEM Code or AFSC, and the overall promotion quota is then applied to each list. After the selection results are approved, the data is transmitted to the military personnel section. 9.21. Promotion Score Notices
Promotion score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the
promotion consideration process and should never be provided to or used by anyone other than the
individual and his or her commander. An Airman’s scores cannot be disclosed without the
Airman’s written consent. Commander’s support staffs, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not
authorized access to promotion scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of
promotion selection or non-selection results and may need to review their score notices to
determine status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and advisory
counseling on behalf of the Airmen and must not allow further dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice on the virtual military personnel flight after
the initial promotion selection for the current cycle. Individuals can also compare their scores with
the promotion statistics available in the military personnel flight or posted on the virtual military
personnel flight through the Air Force Personnel Center
(https://www.afpc.af.mil/Promotion/Enlisted-Promotions/).
