### Individual Financial Responsibilities
According to AFI 1-1, just like physical fitness is important for health, “fiscal fitness” is equally
important to overall well-being of USAF members. Two key aspects of individual financial
responsibility are the establishment of a personal budget and effective management of one’s debt. It is important to review Leave and Earnings Statements (LES) on a regular basis, file travel
vouchers on a timely basis, and use the government travel charge card (GTCC) to pay for all costs
related to official government travel. Official government travel is defined as travel under official
orders while performing duties pertaining to official government assignments such as temporary
duty (TDY) and permanent change of station (PCS). Additional information on financial
responsibilities, pay and allowances, and related entitlements can be found in the Joint Travel
Regulation, DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Military Pay Policy—Active Duty and Reserve Pay, and AFMAN 65-116, Volume 1, Defense
Joint Military Pay System Active Component (DJMSAC) Financial Management Flight (FMF)
Procedures. 12.2. Military (Basic) Pay
Basic pay is the fundamental component of military pay, and typically the largest component of
a member’s pay. Annual military pay raises are set by Congress and the U.S. President in the
National Defense Authorization Act. In accordance with federal law, the 1 January annual pay
raise will automatically match the private sector wage increases, as measured by the Employment
Cost Index for the previous year. If national emergencies or serious economic conditions affect
general welfare, the U.S. President may propose that Congress instill a lower annual pay raise. Military Pay Date. The military pay date determines the length of service for pay purposes. In
general, the pay date should be the same date the individual entered on RegAF status if he or she
had no prior service before entering the USAF. However, if the individual previously served in
certain governmental agencies, the USAF adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for these periods. In the event of periods of absence without leave, desertion, and sickness or injury due to personal
misconduct, negative pay date adjustments may result. 12.3. Leave and Earnings Statement
The LES, titled the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Form 702, Defense Finance
and Accounting Service Military Leave and Earnings Statement, is a comprehensive statement of
a member’s entitlements, deductions, allotments, leave information, tax-withholdings, as well as
Traditional and Roth Thrift Savings Plan information. PCS is a time for Airmen to “apply
increased attention” to their LES since many times entitlements such as BAH, COLA, etc. change
when moving from one duty location to another. And PCSing usually occurs more frequently than
a birth, marriage, divorce, etc. The myPay system allows members to view their LES as well as
initiate changes to selected items affecting their pay. If pay varies significantly, consult the
servicing finance office. Regular Pay Schedule. Military members are paid on a monthly basis with the option to receive
<!-- Page 226 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
226
payments once or twice per month. Members receive a statement (net pay advice) of the net
amount of pay and the financial statement at mid-month (if receiving a payment), and a
comprehensive statement of pay (the LES) at the end of the month via myPay. These statements
are created centrally by DFAS. The pay system has processing cutoff dates for computing, preparing, and transferring funds so DFAS can stop processing transactions against pay accounts
for the current period and begin the regular payroll process. While cutoff dates fluctuate from
month to month, they generally occur around the 6th for the mid-month and the 20th for the endof-month paydays. Local, Partial, and Emergency Partial Payments. Local cash payments are normally only
authorized for overseas areas where on base military banking facilities are not readily available. Exceptions may be granted for members assigned to classified or contingency operations where
the exigencies of their assignments may require local cash or partial payments. The member’s
commander may authorize immediate cash payments up to the amount of accrued entitlement to
date when deemed appropriate to the mission. Non-cash partial payments may be made via
electronic funds transfer and deposited into the member’s financial institution, normally in two to
three business days. Partial payments are limited to the amount of pay and allowances the member
has accrued to the date of the payment. Partial payments are recouped in full on the next available
payday. Under extenuating circumstances, a stateside member may receive an emergency partial
payment if deemed time sensitive and required within 24 hours due to unforeseen circumstances. 12.4. Military Allowances and Entitlements
Allowances are provided for specific needs, such as food or housing. Monetary allowances are
provided when the government does not provide for that specific need. For example, those who
live in government housing do not receive full housing allowances, and those who do not live in
government housing receive allowances to assist with the cost of obtaining commercial housing. Many allowances are not taxable, which is an additional embedded benefit of military pay. A
complete list of military benefits and entitlements can be found at on the MyAirForceBenefits
website: https://www.myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil/. You can also view your annual Personal
Statement of Military Compensation (PSMC) on myPay: https://mypay.dfas.mil which can be
used to show your total compensation when comparing civilian employment offers or applying
for credit or loans. Basic Allowance for Subsistence. Basic allowance for subsistence is a nontaxable allowance
used to offset the cost of a service member’s meals. Often junior grade enlisted members assigned
to single-type government quarters at their permanent duty station are required to eat in
government dining facilities, receive basic allowance for subsistence, and are charged the
discounted meal rate which is deducted from their pay. When certified by the commanding officer
or designee, members are allowed to claim reimbursement for missed meals. Basic Allowance for Housing. The intent of basic allowance for housing is to provide uniformed
service members accurate and equitable housing compensation based on housing costs in local
civilian housing markets. This allowance is payable when government quarters are not provided. Many USAF installations have privatized quarters. Members in privatized quarters are entitled to
basic allowance for housing. A rental agreement requires a rent amount not to exceed the basic
allowance for housing entitlement paid via allotment. Note: Members without dependents
residing in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial basic allowance for housing
unless the quarters (including government-leased quarters) exceed the minimum standards of
single quarters for their grade. Members living in single-type government quarters who pay courtordered child support may qualify for differential (basic allowance for housing-differential). <!-- Page 227 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

Overseas Housing Allowance. Overseas housing allowance is a cost reimbursement-based
allowance to help defray housing costs incident to assignments to a permanent duty station outside
the United States. Members are reimbursed actual rental costs not to exceed the maximum
overseas housing allowance rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. Move-in housing
allowance (for those who qualify) is based on the average “move-in” costs for members. Monthly
overseas housing allowance includes the rent (up to the rental allowance at a permanent duty
station) plus the utility/recurring maintenance allowance. Family Separation Housing. The purpose of family separation housing is to pay a member for
added housing expenses resulting from enforced separation from dependents. Family separation
housing-basic allowance for housing is payable in a monthly amount equal to the withoutdependent basic allowance for housing rate applicable to the member’s grade and permanent duty
station. Family separation housing-overseas housing allowance is payable in a monthly amount
up to the without-dependent overseas housing allowance rate applicable to the member’s grade
and permanent duty station. 12.5. Clothing Replacement Allowance
Enlisted military members receive an annual allowance to help maintain, repair, and replace initial
issue uniform items, as necessary. Clothing replacement allowance-basic is a preliminary
replacement allowance paid annually between the 6th and 36th month of RegAF status. Clothing
replacement allowance-standard automatically replaces clothing replacement allowance-basic
after 36 months of RegAF status. Entitlement to either allowance depends on the individual’s
“entered on RegAF status date” in his or her master military pay account. 12.6. Family Separation Allowance
Family separation allowance is payable to members with dependents in addition to other
allowances or per diem to which a member may be entitled. The purpose of family separation
allowance is to compensate qualified members for added expenses incurred due to an enforced
family separation. Family separation allowance-restricted applies when transportation of
dependents is not authorized at government expense, and the dependents do not live in the vicinity
of the member’s permanent duty station. Family separation allowance-temporary applies when a
member is on temporary duty away from the permanent duty station continuously for more than
## days, and the member’s dependents are not residing at or near the temporary duty station, including members beginning temporary duty before reporting to the initial station of assignment. 12.7. Station Allowances Outside the Continental United States
Overseas station allowances are established to help defray the higher-than-normal cost of living
or cost of procuring housing in overseas areas. Allowances authorized by the Department of
Defense at certain overseas locations may include temporary lodging allowance and cost-of-living
allowance. Members receive information regarding their specific entitlements during inprocessing at the new location. Members may also receive information from their local finance
office upon notification of a pending overseas assignment. 12.8. Basic Needs Allowance
Provides a taxable monthly allowance for Airmen and Guardians who voluntarily apply and
whose Gross Household Income (GHI) and household size places them below 150 percent of
Federal poverty guidelines (FPG) for their geographical location. 12.9. Federal Tax Advantage
<!-- Page 228 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
228
Service members do not pay federal or state taxes on BAH or BAS which significantly increases
their purchasing power for food and housing. In addition to the federal tax advantage, military
members also enjoy combat tax exclusion and fully deductible mortgage interest. 12.10. Continental United States Cost-of-Living Allowance
The CONUS cost of living allowance is payable to members assigned to designated “high cost”
areas within the CONUS. For additional information, see the DoD Financial Management
Regulation (DoDFMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 67, Military Pay Policy—Active Duty
and Reserve Pay. 12.11. Special and Incentive Pay
A number of special and incentive pays recognize certain aspects of duty, such as hazardous duty
incentive pay, imminent danger pay, special duty assignment pay, enlisted flying duty incentive
pay, and hardship duty pay-location. Enlistment and retention bonuses are also considered as
special and incentive pay. 12.12. Involuntary Deductions
Involuntary deductions are payroll deductions of certain amounts of pay that are imposed by law. Examples of involuntary deductions are provided here. Withholding Income Tax. All pay is considered income for federal and state income tax
purposes, to include basic pay, incentive pay, special pay, lump-sum payment of accrued leave, and separation pay. The LES reflects the current month and year-to-date income for social
security, federal income tax, and state income tax purposes under the headings “FICA TAXES,”
“FED TAXES,” and “STATE TAXES” in the middle of the form. Federal Insurance Contributions Act Taxes. The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)
requires federal agencies to withhold FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes from the basic
pay of military members covered by the Social Security Act and to pay matching FICA taxes to
the Social Security Administration. Federal Income Tax Withholding. The Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW) is used to
provide for national programs, such as defense, community development, and law enforcement. A member may authorize an additional monthly amount of FITW. For additional information, the
FITW complies with the Treasury Department Circular E, addressed in military service
directives. State Income Tax Withholding. The State Income Tax Withholding (SITW) refers to state tax
laws of the state where the member is a legal resident. The amount withheld depends upon the
state tax rate. One-time payments may also be subject to state tax. The state for tax purposes is
reflected in the first column on the LES under STATE TAXES. Armed Forces Retirement Home. Monthly Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH)
deductions from the pay of regular enlisted members, up to a maximum of $1, are set by the
Secretary of Defense after consulting with the AFRH board. Deductions collected help support
the U.S. Soldiers’, Airmen’s, and Naval Homes. 12.13. Voluntary Deductions
Military members may establish voluntary deductions, such as allotments to help administer
personal finances, support family members, and insurance premium payments. Members may
control certain discretionary allotments through myPay. Nondiscretionary allotments have limited
uses, such as charitable contributions, loan repayments to the Air Force Aid Society, garnishment
<!-- Page 229 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
229
for commercial debts, and delinquent travel charge card debt. Members are not authorized to start
allotments for purchase, lease, or rental of personal property. To allow for sufficient processing time, allotments should be requested 30 days before the desired
month. Normally, if the member is paid twice a month, the allotment is deducted in equal amounts
from the mid-month and end-of-month pay. If the individual receives pay once a month, the entire
amount is deducted from the monthly paycheck. Thrift Savings Plan. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a voluntary deduction. It is a retirement
savings and investment plan established for federal employees as part of the Federal Employees’
Retirement Act of 1986. The plan offers tax-deferred advantages similar to those in an individual
retirement account or 401(k) plan. Traditional TSP contributions can be taken out of pay before
taxes are computed, resulting in reduced individual tax obligations. Roth TSP contributions are
taken out of pay after income is taxed. When funds are withdrawn at a future date, contributions
will be tax-free since taxes were already paid on the contributions. A member is enrolled into the Blended Retirement System (BRS) if they enlisted on or after 1
January 2018, and will be automatically enrolled in TSP at the level of 5% individual contribution
from his or her monthly basic pay or inactive duty pay. The amount will be contributed to the
member’s TSP account beginning with the first pay period following the member’s 60th day of
service as calculated from the Pay Entry Base Date (PEBD). If a member is contributing to the TSP from basic pay, the member is authorized to contribute
bonuses, incentive, or special pay. As of January 2023, the maximum TSP contribution amount
is $22,500 for deferred and Roth contributions and up to $66,000 total combined deferred/exempt
Traditional and Roth contributions. Members are not permitted to contribute more than 92 percent
of their basic pay so that required deductions of social security and Medicare can be made. Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance. The Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI)
is a voluntary deduction. The maximum amount of SGLI coverage is $500,000 and members are
covered, by law, at the maximum rate unless they decline or reduce coverage. SGLI automatically
insures an eligible member against death when the member is on RegAF status and/or training for
an ordered period of more than 30 days. However, an individual may choose less coverage in
amounts divisible by $50,000 or elect no coverage, but he or she must do so in writing. Additionally, family SGLI covers spouses and dependent children when the eligible member also
participates in SGLI coverage, including military spouses. There is a monthly deduction for
spousal coverage, based on the amount of coverage. Each child is covered in the amount of
$10,000 at no cost to the member. The member may not elect to insure any child for less than
$10,000. SGLI and family SGLI premiums are deducted from members’ military pay each month. The military personnel section is the office of primary responsibility for administering the
program. 12.14. Financial Obligations
Military members will pay their financial obligations in a proper and timely manner; provide
adequate financial support of a spouse, child, or any other relative for which the member receives
additional support allowances; comply with the financial support provisions of a court order or
written support agreement; and respond to applications for involuntary allotments of pay within
the established suspense dates. DAFI 36-2906, Personal Financial Responsibility, provides
administrative and management guidelines and rules. Handling Complaints. Complainants are often unfamiliar with USAF organizational addresses
or do not know the member’s actual unit of assignment, and so frequently address correspondence
<!-- Page 230 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
230
to the installation commander, Staff Judge Advocate, or force support squadron. Complaints are
forwarded for action to the individual’s immediate commander and the complainant is notified of
the referral. Commanders will attempt to respond within 15 days. Failure to pay debts or support
dependents can lead to administrative or disciplinary action. Commanders must actively monitor
complaints until they are resolved. If the commander decides the complaint reflects adversely on
the member, this action should be included in the unfavorable information file. If the member has
separated with no further military service or has retired, the complainant is notified and informed
that the member is no longer under USAF jurisdiction and the USAF is unable to assist. Note: Retired members’ retirement pay can be garnished for child support or alimony obligations. Federal Government Collection of Debts. A USAF member who owes debts to the government
does not have to give his or her consent for the USAF to collect. Generally, for debts exceeding
$100, the individual must receive notification of the pending collection of a debt and be given a
chance to repay the debt before any withholding action occurs. However, due process need not be
completed before the start of a collection action if an individual’s estimated date of separation is
not sufficient to complete collection and the USAF would be unlikely to collect the debt or when
the collection action can be completed within two monthly pay periods. The USAF may also
collect debts involving any federal agency, portions of a retention bonus not served, delinquent
hospital bills for family members, excess shipment of household goods, loss or damage to
government property, and erroneous payments made to or on behalf of the member by the USAF. Waiver and Remission Provisions. Military members may request relief from valid debts by
applying for waiver or remission of the debt. The local financial services office has specific
guidance and can provide assistance regarding these programs. Waiver of Claims for Erroneous Payments of Pay and Allowances. When a member receives
erroneous pay or allowances, he or she may apply for a waiver of claims by the United States. A
waiver may be granted when there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of
good faith on the part of the member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver
of the claim. DFAS will rule on all waivers. Remission. A RegAF, separated member, or his or her commander, may apply for remission of a
member’s indebtedness to the United States. The USAF may not remit or cancel any debt due to
non-collection of court-martial forfeiture. In addition to the circumstances creating the debt and
the issue of good faith on the part of the member, financial hardship may be a factor for
consideration. <!-- Page 231 -->

### Authorized Expenses and Allowances
Individuals are often expected to travel, whether associated with PCS or temporary duty, to
include professional military education and training. Costs associated with official travel are often
reimbursable, but individuals must understand and adhere to specific travel regulations accurately
and within a timely manner. 12.16. Permanent Change of Station Allowances and Expenses
When military members are ordered to perform a PCS, there are travel allowances for expenses
incurred related to transportation, lodging, household goods, etc. Individually billed account
(IBA) government ravel charge card usage is authorized and highly encouraged for all PCS related
expenses. Some of these allowances are addressed below. Permanent Change of Station Advance Payments. Advance payments of pay and allowances
provide members with funds to meet extraordinary expenses directly related to a governmentordered relocation and not covered by other entitlements. A PCS advance payment is an advance
of up to three months of basic pay, less mandatory deductions and debts currently being deducted. All Airmen who are E-3 and below must have approval of their immediate commander to receive
advance pay. All Airmen who request a repayment period greater than 12 months or request an
amount greater than one month’s basic pay, must have approval of their immediate commander. Repayment periods greater than 12 months are only approved in cases of financial hardship. Shipment of Household Goods. A member ordered on a PCS move may ship household goods
within certain weight limitations at government expense. Authorized weight allowances normally
depend on the grade of the member and number of dependents. A member may be reimbursed for
personally arranging for the shipment of household goods. Claims should be prepared and
submitted according to service instructions. The government cost limit is based on the member’s
maximum household goods weight allowance. If the member transports household goods in excess
of the authorized weight allowance, all payments are based on the authorized weight allowance. Dislocation Allowance. Dislocation allowance is paid at a rate determined by the Secretary of
Defense and payable to all members with dependents when dependents relocate their household
goods in conjunction with a PCS. It is also payable to members without dependents if they are not
assigned permanent government quarters upon arrival at the new permanent duty station. Shipment of Unaccompanied Baggage. The shipment of unaccompanied baggage provision
refers to the portion of the PCS weight allowance ordinarily transported separately from the major
or bulk of household goods and usually is transported by an expedited mode. When the expedited
transportation mode is commercial air, a maximum of 1,000 pounds (net), may be transported. Mobile Home Shipment. Members who own a mobile home should contact the traffic
management office to arrange transportation in lieu of household goods transportation. In certain
circumstances, members may arrange or contract personally for the movement of the mobile home. Shipment of Privately Owned Vehicle. When authorized, members may ship one privately
owned vehicle at government expense when ordered to go on a PCS to, from, or between locations
overseas. Privately owned vehicle storage may be provided or authorized when shipment is
prohibited or restricted. <!-- Page 232 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
232
Government-Procured Transportation. Unless an authorizing/order-issuing official determines
U.S.-certificated air carriers are unavailable, U.S.-certificated air carriers must be used for all
commercial air transportation of persons or property when the government funds the air travel. Documentation explaining why U.S.-certificated air carrier service is not available must be
provided to the traveler. Endorsements on the travel orders or government travel procurement
document made in accordance with service guidance are acceptable. Travel time for travel by
government conveyance (except government automobile) or common carriers obtained by
government-procured transportation is allowed for the actual time needed to travel over the direct
route, including necessary delays for the transportation mode used. Use of Privately Owned Conveyance. Uniformed service policy is to authorize/approve privately
owned conveyance travel if acceptable to the member and advantageous to the government based
on the facts in each case. Other allowable travel and transportation options include government
conveyance or commercial carrier. Reimbursement of parking fees, ferry fares, road, bridge, and
tunnel tolls are authorized for privately owned conveyance over the most direct route between the
stations involved. The member is also authorized a flat per diem rate for each PCS travel day
between authorized points, up to the allowable travel time. Personally Procured Transportation. Department of Defense policy mandates the use of the
commercial travel office for all official transportation requirements. A member who, despite the
policy, procures common carrier transportation at personal expense for official travel, is authorized
reimbursement (except transoceanic travel in which no reimbursement is authorized) up to the
amount authorized. However, reimbursement must not exceed the cost for the authorized
transportation and accommodations over a usually traveled direct route according to a schedule
necessary to meet the requirements of the order. Consult the Joint Travel Regulation for additional
information. Mixed Modes. When both government-procured and personally procured modes of transportation
are used, the USAF uses a combination of rules governed by the Joint Travel Regulation. The local
financial service office can provide specific guidance. Dependent Travel. A military member receives monetary allowance in lieu of transportation and
flat rate per diem for the official distance dependents travel with him or her by privately owned
vehicle. If dependents purchase commercial common carrier transportation, the member may be
reimbursed for the actual cost of the transportation, not to exceed the cost the government would
have incurred for ordered travel, and the member receives a per diem allowance for dependents. When the USAF restricts travel of dependents to a location overseas, dependents may move at
government expense to any approved/authorized change of station designated location within the
CONUS or designated overseas location with special approval. Temporary Lodging Expense. A member arriving or departing PCS at a location within the
CONUS may receive temporary lodging expense to help defray the added living expenses incurred
while occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging expense is paid on a travel voucher. Temporary Lodging Allowance. A member arriving or departing PCS at a location outside the
CONUS may receive temporary lodging allowance to help defray the added living expenses
incurred while occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging allowance is paid in military pay
and is reflected on the leave and earnings statement. 12.17. Official Travel Reimbursement
Travelers are responsible for electronically filing a voucher in the Defense Travel System (DTS)
or preparing the DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, to claim reimbursement for
<!-- Page 233 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
233
official travel within five business days upon return to permanent duty station. The traveler’s
signature on the form indicates the claim is accurate, statements are true and complete, and the
traveler is aware of the liability for filing a false claim. Electronic funds transfer is the mandatory
means by which a travel claim is settled. The split disbursement option in DTS will be used. This
option permits direct payment via electronic funds transfer to the GTCC vendor for charges
incurred on the individually billed account. In cases where the traveler is temporary duty for 45
days or more, an interim voucher or scheduled partial payments will be setup in DTS every 30
days with split disbursements used to make on time payments. Extended temporary duty trips do
not excuse on time payments of the GTCC bill. 12.18. Temporary Duty Entitlements
Per Diem. The per diem allowance helps defray the cost of quarters, meals, and certain incidentals. Per diem rates depend on the temporary duty location. Travelers are paid a prescribed amount for
meals and incidental expenses plus the actual amount for lodging, not to exceed the maximum
lodging rate for the specific location. The rates depend on the availability of government facilities, such as quarters and dining facilities. Transportation. Policy mandates that uniformed service members will use available commercial
travel offices to arrange official travel. The mode of transportation used between the points
designated in the travel order will determine the transportation entitlement. On the other hand, if
the member receives authorization to travel at personal expense, he or she will receive a
reimbursement limited to what cost the government would have incurred for the authorized mode
of travel. For questions or concerns, consult the transportation office or commercial travel office
for assistance. Miscellaneous Expenses. Reimbursable travel related expenses include travel from home or place
of lodging to the servicing transportation terminal by taxi, limousine, bus, or privately owned
vehicle. Additional miscellaneous expenses include passports, visas, and rental vehicles, when
authorized on travel orders. 12.19. Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC)
The GTCC program is intended to facilitate and standardize Department of Defense travel, providing travelers a safe, effective, convenient, commercially available method to pay for
expenses incident to official travel, including local travel. The travel card is used to improve cash
management, reduce administrative workloads, and facilitate better service to travelers. In
addition, because of the refund feature of the travel card program, the program results in cost
savings for the Department of Defense. Agency Program Coordinators (APC). An APC is an individual (uniformed member, employee, contractor, or foreign national) designated in writing by a commander or director as
responsible for the management of the GTCC program. APCs are responsible for managing the
travel card program within their hierarchy. Department of Defense GTCC Regulation describes
policies and procedures set forth through the DAF GTCC program. Card Use. Unless otherwise exempted, all Department of Defense personnel are required to use
the government-sponsored, vendor-issued GTCC for all expenses arising from official
government travel. These expenses include lodging, transportation expenses, local ground
transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on travel orders. Cardholders, while in an official
travel status, may use the card for non-reimbursable incidental travel expenses, such as rental
movies, personal telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages when these charges are not part of
a separate room billing or meal. The cardholder is required to pay all charges (whether
<!-- Page 234 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
234
reimbursable or non-reimbursable) via split disbursement. Cash advances may be made with the GTCC to pay for travel-related expenses. Automated teller
machine advances will not be obtained earlier than three working days before scheduled travel and
are limited to authorized expenses exempt from mandatory card usage (meals, incidentals, and
miscellaneous expenses). Transaction fees for automated teller machine use are part of the
incidental expense portion of per diem and are therefore not separate reimbursable expenses. Permanent Change of Station Coordination. Individuals are required to use the GTCC during
a PCS. Credit limit increases and deferred payment options are available to accommodate the
extended travel times of a PCS move. GTCC bills must be kept current while in a PCS status. The
cardholder must notify the losing APC before departing the old duty station and gaining APC
upon reporting to the new duty station. The losing APC will update the travel card account to
reflect “mission critical” status and set a future date in the travel card company’s system to
deactivate the cardholder’s account based on the PCS travel order report no later than date. The
APC will also submit a transfer request to the travel card vendor, so the individual is removed
from that unit’s reporting hierarchy level. The gaining APC will ensure the transfer request is
processed by the travel card vendor when the member arrives at the new station so the account
information can be updated. The gaining APC will also clear the deactivation date within the
travel card vendor’s system. How to Pay the Card Company. The travel card vendor provides detailed monthly bills to
cardholders. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of outstanding balances due in the
monthly billing statement from the travel card vendor. Payments should be made promptly within
the current billing cycle. Military service members must use the split disbursement feature in DTS, which automatically pays the credit card vendor for credit card charges incurred while on official
travel. Card Abuse. The cardholder will only use the GTCC while in official travel status. Commanders
or supervisors will not tolerate the misuse of the GTCC. Cardholders who misuse their GTCC are
subject to appropriate administrative or disciplinary action. Delinquencies. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of the amount stated on the
monthly billing statement. Accounts that reach 31 days past due will be suspended and the
cardholder will need to contact their respective agency program coordinator (APC) to resolve the
issue. For accounts that reach 61 days past due, the GTCC vendor will send a due process letter
and impending salary offset procedures directly to the cardholder. The letter will advise intent to
submit account for salary offset status unless the balance is paid in full within 30 days, or an
acceptable Reduced Payment Plan has been reached between the cardholder and the GTCC
vendor. The first late fee is charged at two cycles plus fifteen days past due (day 75) and then another fee
is assessed each cycle thereafter, until the past due/delinquency amount is paid in full. The travel
card vendor will submit accounts that are 96 days past due for salary-offset processing to Defense
Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS). DFAS will calculate the Salary Offset start and stop
dates, and the number and amount of payments. Fees will also be added to the balance on the
account when it is enrolled in Salary Offset and are not reimbursable. Accounts 181 days past
due will be considered in charged off status regardless of whether or not the cardholder is still
enrolled in salary offset and payments are continuing to be made. Cardholders in this situation
are considered no longer eligible to be reinstated even when the balance is paid off. <!-- Page 235 -->

### Manpower Requirements
Manpower is a constrained resource that comprises a significant portion of the USAF budget. All
missions and programs compete for authorized military and civilian end-strength, and established
grade distributions; therefore, must comply with guidelines as directed by Congress. Manpower
must be programmed in accordance with validated manpower requirements, within fiscal limits
and acceptable risks, as identified in defense planning and programming guidance. The Directorate
of Manpower, Organization and Resources, Program Development Division allocates
programmed manpower resources by command identifier, program element code, resource
identification code, and country state code. These manpower resources are translated into
manpower authorizations by updating the unit manpower document. Major commands should use means other than programmed manpower change requests to
accomplish short-term mission or surge workload requirements, such as: (1) use available funds
and command civilian employment plans to employ civilians; (2) use overtime, temporary fulltime, part-time, or overhire of civilian personnel; (3) seek support from the Air Reserve
Component via military pay appropriation funds; (4) utilize temporary duty military and civilian
personnel; and (5) seek contract service. Changes to command-specific military and civilian
manpower requirements must be validated and approved by HAF before they can be used in the
programming and resourcing process. 12.21. Determining Manpower Requirements
Three types of manpower are used to conduct the USAF mission: military personnel, in-service
civilian employees, and contracted services. In accordance with Department of Defense guidance, the services assign military personnel only to positions that directly contribute to the prosecution
of war; are military by law, custom, or tradition; or are needed for overseas rotation, operational
deployment augmentation, or career field sustainment. The USAF manpower requirements
determination process systematically identifies minimum-essential manpower required for the
most effective and economical accomplishment of approved missions and functions within
organizational and resource constraints. Determining the correct military manpower required to
meet the USAF’s most stringent wartime missions is key to the national military strategy. The defense planning guidance defines the planning scenarios used to size and shape the Total
Force. Manpower requirements are sized for the most demanding phase of the scenario construct, including rotational forces needed for prolonged conflicts. These scenarios drive force structure
and manpower military budgeting decisions. Manpower and organization flight personnel assist
USAF commanders and functional managers by objectively quantifying manpower requirements
for the distribution of USAF manpower resources. Key services of this competency include
peacetime manpower standards development, wartime manpower requirements, and commercial
services management actions, such as public-private competition, in-sourcing, and business
process reengineering. 12.22. Unit Manpower Document
According to AFI 38-101, a manpower requirement is defined as the manpower needed to
accomplish a job, mission, or program. A manpower requirement can be documented as a funded
manpower authorization or an unfunded requirement. The Unit Manpower Document (UMD) is
<!-- Page 236 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
236
the primary document that reflects the manpower required to accomplish the unit mission. It is a
computer-generated product that lists unit funded and unfunded manpower requirements used to
help manage manpower resources. The UMD contains data elements that identify unique position
attributes, to include position number, Air Force Specialty Code, functional account code, office
symbol code, grade, personnel accounting symbol, and reason code. Supervisors should routinely check the UMD for accuracy and use it to track their authorized
manpower strength. If a unit needs to change an existing requirement on the UMD, a manpower
change request with justification is submitted to the servicing manpower organization. Approved
changes to the UMD are reflected by a change notice generated by the manpower programming
and execution system. 12.23. Manpower and Organization Flight
The installation Manpower and Organization Flight performs a variety of functions to help
effectively manage manpower resources. The core competencies of manpower and organization
encompass organization structure, requirement determination, program allocation and control, and
process improvement. Personnel within the flight provide day-to-day manpower resource
management services, to include: UMD management, assistance with manpower change requests, change notices, and organizational structure changes. Manpower and Organization Flight
personnel also provide other management services, such as performance management, commercial activity services, the Airmen Powered by Innovation Program, continuous process
improvement, and management advisory studies. 12.24. Commercial Services Management
Commercial Services Management is a program designed to improve USAF functions using a
variety of management tools including competitive sourcing, in-sourcing, and post-competition
accountability. The major command Manpower Organization and Resources Office is the
manpower function responsible for providing commercial services management oversight at
command levels and providing guidance to Manpower and Organization Flights for
implementation of the Commercial Services Management Program at the respective wings. The
three principal goals of the program are to sustain readiness, improve performance and quality by
doing business more efficiently and cost effectively, and focus available personnel and resources
on core USAF missions. Commercial Services Management will not affect military-essential skills
or those functions that are inherently governmental. The Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency
develops and maintains tools, templates, and guidebooks to enable the field to execute the
Commercial Services Management Program, administers the inherently governmental/commercial
activities inventory, monitors post competition accountability, and provides field support on
Commercial Services Management initiatives. 12.25. Competitive Sourcing Process
Competitive sourcing generates savings by finding more efficient ways to accomplish a particular
function. A competitive sourcing study is a public-private competition that compares the total cost
of the in-house government operation of an activity to the total cost of private sector performance
of the same activity to determine which is the most economical or efficient approach. In a competitive sourcing study, the mission remains essentially unchanged. It is the composition
of the workforce that changes. Where blue suiters (military personnel) were initially performing
the mission, the resulting service provider will be made up of either civil servants or private sector
contract employees. A competitive sourcing study frees up military personnel to perform other
core military essential activities. <!-- Page 237 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
237
In-sourcing. In-sourcing is the conversion of a contracted function to Department of Defense
civilian or military performance, or vice versa. An in-sourcing business case analysis compares
the cost of a contracted function to the cost of Department of Defense civilian employees to
perform the same activity. Included in the business case analysis are certifications validating
contract cost, in-house manning, available labor pool, and activity all meet the requirements of a
valid and enduring mission requirement. Implementing the program permits the Department of
Defense to convert contracts and provides special consideration for using Department of Defense
civilian employees to perform functions currently performed by a contractor. This process is
applicable when the function: (1) has been performed by Department of Defense civilian
employees at any time during the previous 10 years; (2) is closely associated with the performance
of an inherently governmental function; (3) has been performed pursuant to a contract awarded on
a noncompetitive basis; and (4) has been determined by a contracting officer to have been
performed poorly during the five years preceding the date of such determination, because of
excessive costs or inferior quality. Note: In accordance with the Deputy Secretary of Defense
memorandum for in-sourcing contracted services-implementation guidance, contracted functions
found to be inherently governmental, exempt from contract performance, unauthorized personal
services, or experiencing problems associated with contract administration shall be in-sourced
regardless of cost. <!-- Page 238 -->

### Resource Requirements
All USAF resources have a value or cost associated with them. The USAF resource management
system is focused on outputs and resources used, managers effectively using resources, measuring
actual performance compared to planned performance, and using financial plans and accounting
to enhance management controls at each organizational level. The resource management system
provides a way to establish priorities, choose policies, and act to get the desired results and required
resources at acceptable costs. 12.27. Resource management responsibilities
Although base-level resource managers do not control initial allocation of all their resources, they
must effectively manage these resources, including the stewardship of money, manpower, and
equipment. Being an effective steward involves more than legal accountability. There are key duty
positions associated with the resource management system that provide structure and alignment of
resources and resource management. While every USAF member has a principal responsibility to
ensure resources are used in the most cost-effective manner, commanders and supervisors are
responsible for the efficient and economical use of all resources in their organizations, as well as
the budgeting, allocation, composition, and distribution of these resources. Commanders. Commanders review, validate, and balance the financial plan to ensure successful
financial management. Commanders must actively review financial programs for work centers
(responsibility centers) and improve resource management by inquiring about program conditions, reviewing causes, weighing alternatives, and directing action. Commanders must also ensure
resource management system success by allocating sufficient resources to resource management
system training and resource management team efforts. Comptrollers. Comptrollers support the organization’s mission and the USAF by providing sound
financial management and advice to commanders and staff. Comptrollers promote responsible and
proper financial management to ensure efficient, economical use of resources consistent with
statutory and regulatory requirements. Comptrollers apply policies and procedures that enable the
organization to carry out accounting, budget, and cost functions. Responsibility Center Managers. Responsibility center managers plan, direct, and coordinate
subordinate organization activities. Responsibility center managers analyze subordinate
organizational plans, identify imbalances in resource distribution, analyze alternative actions, and
balance programs. Cost Center Managers. The cost center is the basic production flight or work center. The cost
center manager regulates the consumption of work hours, supplies, equipment, and services to do
the tasks within their cost center. Cost center managers shift resources to or from various
production tasks within the cost center to ensure the proper mix or to provide the emphasis
required. Resource Advisors. Resource advisors monitor and help prepare resource estimates. They help
develop obligations and expense fund targets, monitor the use of resources in daily operations
compared to projected consumption levels, and serve as the primary point of contact on resource
management matters pertaining to their responsibility center. Resource advisors are appointed in
<!-- Page 239 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
239
writing by the responsibility center manager. The Financial Management Board. Established by the senior or host commander at each base, the financial management board determines program priorities and ensures effective allocation of
reviews and approves or disapproves
resources. The
recommendations made by the financial working group to ensure balanced, valid financial
programs, and to consider all known or anticipated requirements. financial management board
The Financial Working Group. Composed of both line and staff resource advisors and
responsibility center managers, the financial working group manages commodities and resources
integral to the operating activities of the base or unit. The financial working group develops
requirements and revisions for the base or unit financial plan, reviews all appropriated fund
financial plans, and makes recommendations to the financial management board for final approval. Additionally, the financial working group presents recommendations to the financial management
board for unfunded requirement prioritization and fund target adjustments between responsibility
centers and base-level budgetary guidance. The financial working group provides technical
guidance to base activities on using their primary responsibility resources. Organizational Finance and Budgeting. The operating budget covers costs associated with the
operation of all USAF organizations. The approval by higher headquarters gives obligation
authority to accomplish the mission. The budget program operates on a fiscal year basis (1 October
through the following 30 September). 12.28. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process
The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Process is the Department of
Defense’s resource allocation system. The ultimate objective of the process is to provide the best
mix of forces, equipment, manpower, and support attainable within fiscal constraints according to
DoDD 7045.14, The Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) Process. The
goal of the process is to achieve the defense objectives established by the
U.S. President and the Secretary of Defense outlined in the strategic planning and joint planning
guidance. This system helps leaders establish and forecast a budget to ensure sufficient funds are
available and increases management effectiveness by applying judgment and experience to
programs, resource limitations, other program adjustments, and assessing alternatives for mission
accomplishment. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Phases. The PPBE process has a
framework that decides on future capabilities and provides an opportunity to reexamine prior
decisions in light of evolving threats, economic conditions, and security concerns. It consists of
four interrelated and overlapping phases: planning, programming, budgeting, and execution. Planning. The USAF translates top-down guidance into plans and requirements for which a future
year’s defense program can be developed. Planning defines and examines alternative strategies
and analyzes external conditions and trends. During the planning phase, changes and long-term
implications of decisions are examined. Streamlined planning and assessments help prioritize
objectives, assess strategies, and provide the link between planning and programming. Planning
also provides an objective against which the USAF can measure execution success. Programming. During the programming phase, planning policies and guidance are addressed, and
initial program costs are established. By programming, the USAF matches available resources
(fiscal, manpower, and materiel) against validated requirements to achieve the strategic plan and
submit program proposals. The key objective of programming is to develop a balanced, capabilities-based Air Force Program Objective Memorandum (POM). In addition, the USAF
<!-- Page 240 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
240
defends the POM during program review and budget review and adjusts the program as a result of
the Office of the Secretary of Defense reviews and changing national and international situations. While the USAF and other military departments link planned requirements with the resources
needed to provide them, tradeoffs are inevitably involved beyond those in the planning process. Budgeting. The budgeting phase occurs concurrently with the programming phase. Each
Department of Defense Component submits a proposed budget estimate simultaneously with a
POM. The budgeting phase of formulation and justification provides a platform for a detailed
review of a program’s pricing, phasing, and overall capability to be executed on time and within
budget. The budgeting process principally addresses the years to be justified in the U.S. President’s
budget. Three things happen in the preparation of the budget estimate submission. First, USAF
budget analysts identify situations where the program has put USAF resources at risk of Office of
the Secretary of Defense or congressional reduction. Second, the comptroller applies the latest
inflation figures and flying hour and manpower rates, etc. Third, the program is put into the Office
of the Secretary of Defense budget format and budget justification documentation is prepared. Once these steps are completed, the final position is called the POM/budget estimate submission
or program budget review. The budgeting phase continues with the program budget review
submission and fact-of-life changes via notification document in the off-year. Execution. The execution phase focuses on running the USAF day to day. Execution is carried
out at applicable organizational levels. The USAF major commands and HAF are allocated their
share of obligation authority to execute their missions in accordance with approved integrated
priority lists for those programs that are centrally managed. Because the budget being executed in
any given year was actually compiled over a year earlier, some assumptions on which the budget
was based will have changed. Because change is anticipated, Congress allows some flexibility
within the operating budgets to move resources without requiring their permission, but installations
are expected to execute to the integrated priority list for centrally managed programs. One key part
of the execution phase is the major command operations and maintenance operation plan. USAF
program execution is reviewed during the budget execution reviews in February, April (concurrent
with the internal USAF mid-year review), and July. 12.29. Future Years Defense Program
The Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is a database that summarizes forces, resources, and
equipment associated with all Department of Defense programs. The program displays total
Department of Defense resources and force structure information in three basic dimensions: the
organizations affected (military departments and defense agencies), appropriations accounts
(research, development, test, and evaluation; and operation and maintenance), and major force
programs (strategic forces and mobility forces). The FYDP is updated twice during the PPBE
Process cycle, first upon submission of the POM (usually July/August), and again upon submission
of the U.S. President's budget (early February the following year). The FYDP is composed of 11
major force programs and over 3,600 active program elements designed to categorize functional
or organizational entities and their related resources. 12.30. USAF Equipment Management System
The USAF equipment management system provides worldwide visibility of all equipment assets
throughout the USAF. The system helps to support reporting capitalized asset depreciation, determining equipment requirements based on USAF allowance standards, supporting the budget
and buy program, and identifying equipment types and quantities required to accomplish the
mission. USAF allowance standards identify specific items and quantities approved by the
functional manager for units to use during wartime and peacetime operations. These allowance
<!-- Page 241 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
241
standards are accessible online from the USAF Equipment Management System and the
Allowance Standard Retrieval System website. Responsibilities. The USAF’s mission makes it imperative that all military and civilian personnel
operate and maintain government systems, equipment, supplies, and real property in the best
possible condition, readiness, and in the absolute minimum quantity necessary to accomplish
assigned tasks. Additionally, Airmen at all levels must accurately maintain property records to
reflect a current inventory and condition of property; ensure personnel carefully and economically
use and safeguard property; provide adequate security, protection, and storage for property; and
make recommendations for preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. Ultimately, USAF members must
have supply discipline to conserve, protect, and maintain available government supplies, equipment, and real property for operational requirements. Commanders and Supervisors. Commanders and supervisors at all levels are responsible for
prudent management, control, storage, and cost-effective use of government property under their
control. Commanders and supervisors establish controls to eliminate uneconomical equipment
management, ensure all personnel are taught proper care and safeguard principles, and enforce
these principles. Commanders must properly manage public property under their control, provide
instructions to subordinates on specific responsibilities, and maintain records that may be audited. Commanders appoint representatives, designate property custodians and facility managers, and
ensure the representatives attend the proper training offered by logistics readiness squadrons. Property Custodian. A property custodian is appointed by an accountable property officer, commander, or chief of staff agency to accept responsibility for property and are directly
responsible for the physical custody, inventory, accounting, and reconciliation of items on the
account. A custodian may be held financially liable for the loss, theft, destruction, or damage of
any property or resources under his or her control and must report property losses or irregularities
to commanders or accountable officers at the time of discovery. For additional information on
property custodians and property management, refer to DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and
Management of DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property, and AFI 23-111, Management
of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force. Installation Responsibilities. The installation commander has overall responsibility and
accountability for the operation of a USAF installation. The major command and installation
commander, assisted by the base civil engineer, are responsible for developing, operating, maintaining, and controlling the use of USAF facilities in compliance with applicable Department
of Defense and USAF policies and procedures. They are also responsible for developing
comprehensive asset management plans, identifying facility lifecycle requirements, implementing
applicable common levels of service, assessing the impact of asset condition on mission support
through the use of key performance indicators, and developing and executing real property
construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization programs. Base Civil Engineer Squadron Responsibilities. The base civil engineer is charged with
providing, operating, maintaining, restoring, and protecting the built and natural infrastructure
necessary to support the USAF mission. As such, the base civil engineer serves as the focal point
for all construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization of facilities identified as real
property and associated real property installed equipment. The base civil engineer’s customer
service unit typically manages the installation’s facility manager program, to include providing
initial and recurring training for facility managers. Facility manager training covers facility
manager roles and responsibilities and identifies the processes and procedures required for
submitting work requests. <!-- Page 242 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
242
Civil Engineer Work Requests. The base civil engineer’s customer service unit receives and
reviews all incoming work requests for validity, verifies scope, and ensures the work request is
coordinated with the appropriate agencies, such as fire, safety, and environmental. If the work
request is approved, it will be executed in-house based on priority by the operations flight or as a
contract managed by the engineering flight. Work requests will be identified to the customer
service unit by the facility manager utilizing the AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, or designated information technology systems. Direct Scheduled Work. Direct scheduled work is a request that does not need detailed planning
and can be sent directly to the required shop for execution. An example of a direct scheduled work
is fixing a leaky faucet. Planned Work. Planned work requests are typically complex and require detailed planning, scheduling of multiple shops, and lead time for material acquisition. An example of planned work
is relocating a doorway and associated exit signs to accommodate a new layout. Emergency Work. Emergency work is defined as work that corrects an issue that poses an
immediate threat to mission, life, safety, or health and will be identified to the customer service
unit. Emergency work requests should be requested and accomplished by the quickest means
possible, to include verbal or phone communication. 12.31. Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Prevention
The USAF loses millions of dollars every year due to individuals abusing the system, wasting
precious resources, and committing acts of fraud. Preventing fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) is of
primary concern. While detection and prosecution serve to deter fraudulent, wasteful, or abusive
practices, the key element of the program is to prevent the loss of resources. The Secretary of the
Air Force, Inspector General, provides policy guidance, develops procedures, and establishes and
evaluates the Air Force Complaints. In turn, the IG at every level is responsible for establishing
and directing these programs. Fraud. Fraud is defined as any intentional deception designed to unlawfully deprive the USAF of
something of value or to secure from the USAF for an individual benefit, privilege, allowance, or
consideration to which he or she is not entitled. Fraud may also be considered to be any theft or
diversion of resources for personal or commercial gain. Waste. Waste is defined as the extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of USAF funds or
the consumption of USAF property that results from deficient practices, systems controls, or
decisions. Waste also includes improper practices not involving prosecutable fraud. Wartime and
emergency operations, legitimate stockpiles, and wartime reserves are not considered waste. Abuse. Abuse is defined as the intentionally wrongful or improper use of USAF resources. Examples of abuse include misuse of rank, position, or authority that causes the loss or misuse of
resources, such as tools, vehicles, computers, or office equipment. Fraud, Waste and Abuse Complaints. USAF personnel have a duty to promptly report FWA to
an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an
established grievance channel. FWA complaints may be reported to the Air Force Audit Agency, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), security forces, or other proper authorities. Individuals may submit complaints of FWA by memorandum, in person, or by FWA hotlines. Complaints may also be submitted anonymously. As with personal complaints, USAF members should try resolving FWA issues at the lowest
possible level using command channels before addressing them to a higher level or the IG. Making
<!-- Page 243 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
243
a disclosure or complaint requires factual, unbiased, and specific information. Individuals must
understand they are submitting official statements within USAF channels. Therefore, they remain
subject to punitive action or adverse administrative action for knowingly making false statements
and for submitting other unlawful communications. Complainant Privacy. The complainant’s privacy is safeguarded to encourage voluntary
cooperation and to promote a climate of openness in identifying issues requiring leadership
intervention. The IG has the responsibility to safeguard the personal identity and complaints of
individuals seeking assistance or participating in an IG process, such as an investigation. While
this does not mean the communications made to an IG are privileged or confidential, it does mean
that disclosure of those communications and the identity of the communicant is strictly limited to
an official need-to-know basis, when required by law or regulation, when necessary to take adverse
action against a subject, or with Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General approval. Whistleblower Rights. Whistleblower witnesses have additional rights. The nature of the
allegation and findings will determine what information is releasable. All information released is
according to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act. “Third-party” complainants are not
entitled to a response regarding alleged wrongs not directly affecting them unless authorized to
receive via a Freedom of Information Act or a Privacy Act release. 12.32. Financial Liability Investigation
Upon the discovery of loss, damage, destruction, or theft of government-owned property (real or
personal) of any value, the immediate supervisor within the chain of command shall conduct an
informal inquiry to determine if the situation warrants a formal investigation. An investigation
shall be conducted for all loss, damage, destruction, or theft of government-owned equipment with
an initial acquisition cost of $5000 or greater; all sensitive, classified, or leased (capital lease)
property, regardless of initial acquisition cost; and any real property. However, investigations may
also be conducted when circumstances warrant, such as when the loss, damage, destruction, or
theft of small amounts of property occur frequently enough to suggest a pattern of wrongdoing. The DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, is required documentation
for investigations and is used to document the facts and circumstances of the loss, damage, destruction, or theft. For additional information on the financial liability investigation program, refer to DoDR 7000.14, Financial Management Regulation, Volume 12, Chapter 7, Financial
Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged, Destroyed, or Stolen. <!-- Page 244 -->

### Environmental Responsibilities
The USAF is a leader and devoted guardian of the environment. As trustee to over 8 million acres
of natural habitat, the USAF takes considerable measures to defend and enhance America’s rich
natural resources and cultural heritage. Over the last 20 years, the USAF has followed a
compliance-based approach to environmental management resulting in an unparalleled record of
responsiveness to regulation, community interests, and ecological needs. Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century is aimed at establishing an environment in which
all Airmen are actively eliminating waste and continuously improving processes. AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, implements the environmental management system framework and
provides guidance and procedures applicable to all USAF installations within the United States
territories and foreign countries. 12.34. Environmental Management System
The Department of Defense, as the nation’s largest user of federal lands, consumers of energy, and
operators of large industrial complexes, must strive to ensure efficient operations while reducing
its environmental footprint. All USAF commanders, supervisors, and process owners shall
integrate environmental considerations into daily work activities and at all levels of decisionmaking for current or proposed actions that may adversely impact the environment. The
environmental management system is a set of processes and practices that enable a reduction in
environmental impact and an increase in operating efficiency. Environmental Management System Priorities. Three priorities of the environmental
management system are: compliance, risk reduction, and continuous improvement. Compliance
will be maintained with all environmental legal obligations and regulatory guidelines. Risk
reduction will be achieved through a standardized approach to protect USAF assets, personnel, and material by effectively identifying and managing risks from environmental encroachment. Instilling a culture that encourages and supports continuous improvement will reduce
environmental impacts and regulatory burden. Environmental Management System Phases. The environmental management system is
designed with four phases to help the USAF at all levels maintain compliance with environmental
goals and obligations as outlined in DoDI 4715.17, Environmental Management Systems. Phase 1: Plan. The planning phase includes determining the management system’s scope, environmental policy and commitment statement, environmental aspects and impacts, legal and
other requirements, objectives and targets, and action plans. Effective planning allows the
installation’s leadership to focus resources on mitigating risks that present the greatest threat to
mission capability. Phase 2: Do. The doing phase includes an environmental risk reduction strategy for
environmental aspects associated with the processes or activities that generate pollutants. Each
facility shall identify opportunities to optimize selected business, operational, or industrial
processes or activities in terms of pollutant reduction, lower energy use, reduction in the use of
natural resources, water conservation, and improvements to health and safety. Phase 3: Check. The checking phase includes environmental monitoring and measuring to
<!-- Page 245 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
245
increase leadership awareness of compliance issues, identify and analyze trends of nonconformance and non-compliance, identify areas for improvement, provide lessons learned to
prevent similar non-compliance at other installations, and to minimize or avoid environmental
litigation risks. Phase 4: Act. The acting phase includes the management review to assess the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the management system. 12.35. Environmental Management System Guidance
Program areas identified and outlined in AFI 32-7001 and other environmental AFIs include
environmental protection initiatives aligned with Department of Defense and USAF policies and
programs. Program areas include air quality; water supply; hazardous materials; hazardous waste; solid waste; toxic substances; petroleum, oil, and lubricants; storage tanks; pest management; cultural resources; natural resources; environmental planning; environmental restoration; environmental baseline surveys; and overseas compliance policy. 12.36. Environmental Compliance
The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) is responsible for managing the USAF
compliance, restoration, sustainability, and National Environmental Policy Act programs. AFCEC
provides HAF, major commands, and installations with environmental compliance support, delivering the compliance programming and execution expertise, core knowledge and leadership
required to ensure USAF installations comply with regulatory programs related to air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, hazardous waste generation, and natural and cultural
resource management. AFCEC also serves as the central point for collection and analysis of
environmental data in various program areas. The AFCEC team includes subject matter experts
and program managers in various fields and specialties related to environmental operations, including regulatory compliance, environmental restoration, hazardous waste management, pollution prevention, and environmental assessments.
