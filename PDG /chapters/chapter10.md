### Assignment Eligibility and Restrictions
The USAF classifies and assigns Airmen worldwide to ensure a high state of readiness to
accomplish the mission. The Air Force uses a coherent and logical classification system to identify
valid manpower requirements, to identify and describe each USAF occupational specialty, to
ensure minimum prerequisite standards are set for each specialty, and to ensure qualified Airmen
are placed into each specialty. The Air Force also recognizes the importance of special assignment
considerations for Airmen with exceptional needs. To the maximum extent possible, the USAF
assigns a permanent change of station (PCS) to Airmen on a voluntary basis. When required, the
USAF distributes involuntary assignments among similarly qualified Airmen to minimize family
separation or allow Airmen to tend to essential military and personal responsibilities. Air Force
Reserve assignment may be full-time or part-time, and are all voluntary, thus new assignments
must be applied for, particularly when pursuing promotion opportunities. 10.2. Assignment Authority
Airmen assignments are filled to meet the overall needs of the USAF according to law, Department
of Defense, and instructional guidance. The Department of Defense allocates funds, delegates
authority, and directs policies for the PCS assignments of Airmen to satisfy national security
requirements. The director of assignments (or equivalent), in coordination with major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting units, is authorized to initiate assignments for Airmen
to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. The Air Force Personnel Center is the final approval
authority for assignments in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and below. The Air Force
Executive Talent Management Office is the final approval authority for Chief Master Sergeant and
Chief Master Sergeant-select assignments. DAFI 36-2110, Total Force Assignments, is the
governing instruction for operational (including rotational), training (including formal education
and professional military education), and force structure assignments. 10.3. Assignment Cancellations
Once an Airman is selected for a PCS and orders are published, assignments are not normally
cancelled within 60 days of the projected departure date unless the Airman cannot be effectively
used at the projected location. If the Airman indicates an assignment cancellation will cause
hardship, the Airman will be asked to prepare a written statement to be coordinated through the
unit commander to the military personnel section. Upon receipt, the military personnel section
advises the assignment office of primary responsibility to either consider reinstatement of the
original assignment, provide an alternate assignment, or confirm cancellation with reasons why
the Airman is required to remain at the present base. 10.4. Factors for Distribution of Personnel
While the primary factor in selecting Airmen for a PCS is the Airman’s qualifications to fill a valid
manpower requirement and perform productively in the position, many additional aspects may be
considered for eligibility criteria as well. <!-- Page 182 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
182
Special Experience Identifier. The special experience identifier system complements the
assignment process and is used in conjunction with grade, AFSC, and AFSC prefixes and suffixes, to match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs with special requirements. Special experience
identifiers may be used when specific experience or training is critical, and no other means is
appropriate or available. Manpower positions are coded with a special experience identifier to
identify positions that require or provide unique experiences or qualifications. The personnel
records for Airmen who earn a special experience identifier are similarly coded to rapidly identify
Airmen to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or other critical needs. Security Access Requirement. Some positions require Airmen to have access to a specified level
of classified information. However, sometimes the urgency to fill a position does not allow
selection of Airmen using PCS eligibility criteria, subsequent processing, or investigation for
access at the specified level. Under these circumstances, selection may be necessary from among
Airmen who currently have access or can be granted access immediately. Grade, Air Force Specialty Code, and Skill-Level Relationship for Assignment. Normally, Airmen in the grade of Senior Master Sergeant and below are selected for assignment in their
control AFSC based on their grade and skill level. Airmen with an incompatible grade and control
AFSC skill level due to retraining or reclassification are selected for assignment and allocated
against requirements commensurate with their grade, regardless of their control AFSC skill level. Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects may be assigned in any AFSC or chief
enlisted manager code they possess or are qualified to be awarded. Primarily, Chief Master
Sergeants fill chief enlisted manager code positions; Senior Master Sergeants fill 9-skill level
positions; Master Sergeants and Technical Sergeants fill 7-skill level positions; Staff Sergeants
and Senior Airmen fill 5-skill level positions; and Airman First Class, Airman, and Airman Basic
fill 3-skill level positions. Volunteer Status and Assignment Eligibility. Qualified volunteers should be considered for all
assignments. Volunteers who have not met time on station requirements may be considered before
qualified non-volunteers who have met time on station requirements, but such a qualified
volunteer requires a time on station waiver. A qualified volunteer who meets the minimum time
on station requirement is considered first, based on the order of longest on station. Note: Firstterm Airmen serving an initial enlistment of four or more years may not be given more than two
assignments in different locations following initial basic and skill training during their first four
years of service, regardless of tour length. First-term Airmen who make two PCS moves are
permitted an additional PCS in conjunction with an approved humanitarian reassignment, a join
spouse assignment, as a volunteer, or when the PCS is a mandatory move. Low-cost moves are
excluded from the two-move count. Base of Preference (Enlisted Only). The first-term Airmen and career Airmen may request a base
of preference assignment as an incentive for continued USAF service. First-term Airmen, in
conjunction with reenlistment or retraining, may request a PCS from Continental United States
(CONUS) to CONUS or PCS from overseas to CONUS. Also, first-term Airmen in CONUS may
request a base of preference to remain in place. A PCS base of preference is not authorized from
CONUS to overseas or overseas to overseas. An in-place base of preference is not authorized for
Airmen assigned overseas. Assignment of Military Couples (Join Spouse). Each Airman of a military couple serves in his
or her own right. Military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all Airmen. They are
considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and must perform duties that require
the skills in which they are trained. Provided these criteria are met, military couples may be
considered for assignments where they can maintain a joint residence. Military couples should not
<!-- Page 183 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
183
make decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based on the assumption
they will always be assigned to the same location or that join spouse assignment is guaranteed. Home-Basing and Follow-On Assignment Programs. The purpose of the home-basing and
follow-on assignment programs is to reduce PCS costs, reduce PCS turbulence, and increase
stability for Airmen and their families by providing advance assignment consideration. The
servicing military personnel section must brief all eligible Airmen selected for or electing to serve
an unaccompanied overseas tour of 15 months or less on these programs. Airmen must either apply
or decline to apply for these programs in writing. Assignment of Family Members. Assignment of family members to the same duty location or
unit is not prohibited; however, family members will not be assigned where one family member
will or may hold a command or supervisory position over another family member. Such
assignments result in, or may create a perception of, preferential treatment or loss of impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of command and supervisory functions. Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment Program (Enlisted Only). The voluntary stabilized base
assignment program provides Airmen a stabilized tour in exchange for volunteering for an
assignment to a historically hard-to-fill location. Extended Long Overseas Tour Length. The extended long overseas tour volunteer program
applies to Airmen who volunteer for a PCS overseas to a long-tour location (accompanied tour
length is 24 months or more and unaccompanied tour length is more than 15 months). Airmen who
volunteer for an extended long overseas tour agree to serve the standard tour length plus an
additional 12 months. The 12-month extended tour period is in addition to the normal
(accompanied or unaccompanied) long tour length. A change in status affects the service
retainability that must be obtained and the tour length the Airman will be required to serve. The
requirement for additional service retainability may force an Airman to extend or reenlist and
could affect selective retention bonus calculation. Extended long overseas tour volunteers are
considered ahead of standard overseas tour volunteers according to established USAF priorities. Temporary Duty. The maximum temporary duty period at any one location in a 12-month period
is 180 days unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants a waiver. To the degree possible, Airmen
are not selected for involuntary overseas assignment while performing certain kinds of temporary
duty. If selected, the report no later than date will not be within 120 days of the temporary duty
completion date. 10.5. Service Retainability
Upon selection for assignment, an Airman must have or be able to obtain certain minimum periods
of obligated service depending on the type of PCS move. This committed service retainability
ensures an Airman has a period of RegAF status remaining long enough to offset the costs
associated with a PCS. Airmen who do not have retainability may decline to obtain retainability
or, if eligible, may retire instead of accepting a PCS. Declining to obtain retainability will affect a
career Airman by making him or her ineligible for promotion and reenlistment. Consecutive Overseas Tour. If an Airman is serving overseas and is a volunteer for a consecutive
overseas tour or in-place consecutive overseas tour, the Airman must complete the full-prescribed
tour at the current location and the full-prescribed overseas tour at the new location or another full
tour in place. Dependent Accompanied Overseas. Airmen who are eligible and desire that their dependents
accompany them at government expense during overseas tours, must serve the “accompanied by
dependents” overseas tour length. This tour is normally longer than the unaccompanied tour. <!-- Page 184 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
184
Electing to serve the longer accompanied tour requires the Airman to obtain the obligated service
retainability for the longer tour. Airmen who are either ineligible or decline to obtain the service
retainability for the accompanied tour length will not receive approval for dependent travel at the
government’s expense or command sponsorship. Overseas to Continental United States. Reassignment from overseas to CONUS requires an
Airman, in most cases, to have or obtain at least 12 months of obligated service retainability. Those
Airmen serving overseas who fail to obtain the necessary retainability for reassignment to the
CONUS will be retained in the overseas area until their date of separation. Continental United States to Continental United States. The service retainability requirement
for a CONUS to CONUS PCS is 24 months regardless of career status. 10.6. Time on Station Requirements
Minimum time on station requirements exist to provide continuity to an organization and
reasonable periods of stable family life for Airmen. For most PCS moves within the CONUS, firstterm Airmen and career Airmen must have at least 48 months of time on station, with the exception
of eligible first-term Airmen applying for the first-term Airmen base of preference program. Firstterm Airmen must have at least 12 months of time on station to go from CONUS to overseas. Career Airmen require 24 months of time on station before an overseas PCS. 10.7. Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing
The Enlisted Quarterly Assignment Listing (EQUAL) provides Airmen a listing of the assignment
requirements available for upcoming assignment cycles and allows them the opportunity to align
personal preferences to actual USAF needs. The listing identifies what assignments, by AFSC and
grade, are available at particular locations. EQUAL-Plus is used to advertise requirements for
special duty, joint and departmental, short-notice overseas, and all Chief Master Sergeant
assignments. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, special qualifications needed, available locations, reporting instructions, and points of contact for additional information. Note: Each Airman is individually responsible for the currency and accuracy of assignment preferences. When a change in preference or status occurs, career progression or marriage, Airmen assignment
preferences should be updated accordingly. 10.8. Chief Master Sergeant Development
The Chiefs’ Group uses Chief Master Sergeant assignment policies to support the continued
development of Chief Master Sergeants. Although these assignment policies are comparable with
other senior leader assignments and development methods, they are managed differently than other
enlisted grades. Additional information can be found on the USAF Portal, the Senior Leader Career
Management System Guide, and the Chief Master Sergeant Information Handbook. 10.9. Deferments
Deferments may be authorized in most grades and AFSCs to maintain an equitable assignment
system and also support the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. Deferments are
normally approved to preclude an Airman’s PCS while suitability to remain on RegAF status is
evaluated or during a period of observation or rehabilitation. Deferments also exist for such things
as completion of an educational program or degree, witness for a court-martial, accused in a courtmartial, control roster, Article 15 punishment, base of preference program, retraining, or
humanitarian reasons. Humanitarian Reassignment or Deferment. Humanitarian reassignments or deferments help
Airmen resolve severe short-term problems involving a family member. The problem must be
<!-- Page 185 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
185
resolvable within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months); the Airman’s presence must
be considered absolutely essential to resolve the problem; and the Airman must be effectively
utilized in his or her control AFSC at the new assignment. Family members under the humanitarian
program are limited to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law, and those people who have served
“in loco parentis.” A person “in loco parentis” refers to someone who has exercised parental rights
and responsibilities in place of a natural parent for at least five years before the Airman’s or
spouse’s 21st birthday, or before the Airman’s entry to the RegAF, whichever is earlier. While
brothers and sisters are not included in the definition of family member for humanitarian
consideration, a request involving a brother’s or sister’s terminal illness will be considered as an
exception to policy. Exceptional Family Member Program Reassignment or Deferment. The Exceptional Family
Member Program (EFMP) is based on an Airman’s need for special medical or educational care
for a spouse or child that is required long-term or permanent. This program is not a base-of-choice
program. Assignment decisions are based on manning needs of the USAF at locations where the
special medical or educational needs for a spouse or child can be met. The USAF’s commitment
and responsibilities under the EFMP requires mandatory enrollment and identification of
exceptional family members. Under the EFMP, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need
arises for specialized care that cannot be met where currently assigned. A deferment from an
assignment may be provided for a newly identified condition if the Airman’s presence is
considered essential. The purpose of such a deferment is to allow the Airman time to establish a
special medical treatment program or educational program for the exceptional family member. When granted, the initial period of deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may be
reconsidered for a PCS, if otherwise eligible. Educational Deferment. Airmen who have not yet been selected for a PCS may request deferment
from assignment selection when they have nearly completed a vocational program or college
degree requirements. High School Senior Assignment Deferment Program. Senior Master Sergeants and below, and
officers up through Lieutenant Colonel, may apply for a one-year assignment deferment to
accommodate dependent graduations from high school. Back to back deferments may be possible, and military married to military spouses may also apply. As in all situations, however, the needs
of the USAF will come first and will be the determining factor in granting deferments. Requests
will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and deferments will be approved where possible. Dependent Care and Adoption Deferment. All Airmen ensure dependent care arrangements are
made in the event of temporary duty or PCS. Military couples with dependents and single Airmen
sponsors are expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same basis as other Airmen. They
are eligible for worldwide duty and all assignments for which they qualify. To ensure all Airmen
remain available for worldwide duty, they must have workable plans to provide parent-like care
for their dependents as outlined in DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908, Family Care Plans. Airmen who
cannot or will not meet military commitments due to family needs will be considered for
discharge. Airmen adopting children are given a limited time to complete the official adoption
process and facilitate bonding. Airmen may be authorized deferment during the six-month period
following the date a child is officially placed in the Airmen’s home. Airmen may also be authorized
up to 21 days of permissive temporary duty to be used in conjunction with ordinary leave. 10.10. Expedited Transfers
The Air Force offers expedited transfers to eligible Airmen who file an unrestricted report for
sexual assault, stalking, or other sexual misconduct (i.e., indecent viewing, visual recording, or
<!-- Page 186 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
186
broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure) with assistance from the Sexual Assault
Prevention and Response Office, the Family Advocacy Program Office, the Victim and Witness
Assistance Program in the installation’s Legal Office, or their commander. The Air Force offers
expedited transfers to Airmen whose adult military dependent makes an allegation of non-domestic
abuse sexual assault with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office if the victim has
filed an unrestricted report and the alleged sexual assault offender is a service member or if the
alleged offender or alleged sexual assault has a military nexus (e.g., adult military dependent, works for DoD as a civilian employee (appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees, or is a
government contractor)), or the alleged sexual assault occurred on a DoD installation or facility. The Air Force also offers expedited transfers to eligible Airmen who are victims of physical
domestic violence committed by the spouse or intimate partner of the victim. Airmen may request
an expedited transfer with assistance from the installation Family Advocacy Program Office, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, the Victim and Witness Assistance Program in
the installation’s Legal Office, or their commander. To enhance protection for the sexual assault victim, potential reassignment of the alleged offender
shall be considered by the vice wing commander (or equivalent), balancing interests of the sexual
assault victim and the alleged offender. An Airman (victim or alleged offender) will generally only
be delayed from departing for a PCS when they are required to remain for completion of a criminal
or disciplinary investigation or action in which they are the subject. All assignment action codes
must be removed from the Airman’s personnel file to facilitate PCS eligibility. Retraining or crossflow actions will be considered under this program on a case-by-case basis as the goal for
transferring the Airman is to process a timely reassignment with minimal disruption to an Airman’s
career and family. <!-- Page 187 -->

AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
188
procurement, classification, and training of USAF members in a manner that permits enlisted
personnel to specialize and develop their skills and abilities while allowing the USAF to meet
changing mission requirements. The AFECD is organized in numerical/alphabetical order
according to career field and AFSC. Each career field is described in the AFECD, followed by a
breakdown of each AFSC within that career field. Career fields are classified in the following
manner: Operations (1X), Logistics (2X), Support (3X), Medical (4X), Paralegal and Religious
Affairs (5X), Contracting and Financial (6X), Special Investigations (7X), Special Duty Identifiers
