### Introduction to Aviation History
Aviation history, particularly the early years of aviation fundamentals, provides an understanding
of the foundations of airpower. This chapter on aviation history contains information on the
beginning of the aviation industry and the evolution of airpower in the early days. Material in this
chapter examines how participation in wars and conflicts throughout our history helped drive
innovation and technological advancements to develop the United States (U.S.) Air Force into the
greatest Air Force in the world. Note: Several significant historical events associated with air and
space flight, and most importantly, the legacy of the men and women of the USAF, are foundations
of the Air Force of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Chapters 2 and 3 are designed in chronological
order. Significant events may overlap or may have occurred simultaneously; therefore, dates are
considered for the general purposes of providing a timeline of aviation history and Air Force
heritage. Many military projects, exercises, and operations are identified by names or titles. Several
factors are considered before establishing and publishing names for operations. Operational names
are a combination of one or two separate unclassified words that are assigned an unclassified
meaning and used for unclassified administrative, morale, or public information purposes. Typically, there are four general suggestions for naming operations: make them meaningful, target
key audiences, avoid fashion, and make them memorable. 2.2. First Flights
The dream of flight has nearly always existed. It was when two French brothers launched a hot air
balloon in 1783, that man was able to fly. Approximately a decade later, military aviation became
a noteworthy potential when, in 1794, the French Aerostatic Corps’ balloons accompanied the
Armies of the French Revolution. European advancements in balloons, gliders, and aerodynamics
continued to progress rapidly. By 1853, Britain’s Sir George Cayley created a glider with fixed
wings, cambered airfoil, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These gliders eventually evolved
into flying machines similar to today’s hang gliders. In 1861, a Balloon Corps provided aerial
observation and reconnaissance for the Union Army during the American Civil War. The seven
balloons in the inventory proved to be useful, but they were fragile and vulnerable to weather
conditions. In 1863, the Army disbanded the Union Army Balloon Corps. Orville and Wilbur Wright. In the early 1900s, Orville and Wilbur
Wright conducted more than 1,000 glides and achieved the first powered, sustained, controlled airplane flight, heralding the age of heavier-than-air
President Theodore Roosevelt established an
aviation. When
Aeronautical Division in the U.S. Army’s Signal Corps on 1 August 1907, the Wright Brothers offered the only flyable aircraft that met specifications
for its first military airplane. The flying machine had to carry two people
with a combined weight of 350 pounds or less, and it needed to be able to
fly for 125 miles at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. Despite a crash
on 17 September 1908, seriously injuring Orville and killing passenger
Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge, by 1909 the U.S. Army accepted its first
of many aircraft, the Signal Corps No. 1, from the Wright Company. The Wright Brothers

Subsequently, the Wright Brothers trained several U.S. Army pilots, including Henry H. “Hap”
Arnold, future commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces. 2.3. Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps (1 August 1907 – 18 July 1914)
When the Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps was established in 1907, the Army inevitably found
itself in possession of several balloons that had been retained since the disbandment of the Balloon
Corps. With that discovery, the Army realized the need for trained enlisted men to conduct balloon
inflations and make necessary repairs. That year, Eddie Ward and Joseph Barrett reported in at the
Leo Stevens’ Balloon Factory in New York, New York. They were the first enlisted men in the
Aeronautical Division to be schooled in the rudiments of fabric handling, folding, and stitching. They were also taught the manufacturing of buoyant gases and became experts in the inflation and
control of the Army’s aircraft. Developing an inventory and ensuring the safety of the pilots were two significant concerns
regarding military aviation in the Signal Corps. Enlisted crews not only repaired the planes, but
they also labored to make them safer to fly. They provided day-to-day support for a handful of
officer pilots, learned new skills as airplane mechanicians (aircraft mechanics with skills and
knowledge to maintain and repair aircraft engines, airframes, controls, and systems), and
furthered skills as mechanics, riggers, and fitters. The enlisted detachment was a small band of
enlisted Airmen who shared in the first steps of establishing military aviation as a permanent part
of the nation’s defense. By October 1912, the Aeronautical Division consisted of 11 aircraft with
## flying officers and 39 enlisted mechanics, making it relatively equivalent to forces in Europe. In 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron was activated. It is recognized as the oldest squadron in the USAF. Wright Biplane Chief Mechanic, Frank Scott. Corporal Frank Scott
enlisted in the Field Artillery branch of the U.S. Army in 1908 and crosstrained into the Signal Corps in 1911. He was initially assigned to launching
and releasing of hot air balloons and was soon transferred to work on the
Type-B Wright biplane. As a chief mechanic, Corporal Scott was offered an
opportunity to accompany the pilot, Lieutenant Rockwell, on a test flight. On
## September 1912, when the pilot attempted to land, the aircraft experienced
engine trouble. It unfortunately became Scott’s first and only flight. Both
Corporal Scott and Lieutenant Rockwell lost their lives that day. Corporal
Frank Scott was the first enlisted person to die in an accident in a military
aircraft. Scott Field, now Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, was named in his
honor. First American Enlisted Pilot, Vernon L. Burge. The story of enlisted
pilots began long before the official enlisted pilot training program was
established. In the early 1900’s, Captain Frank P. Lahm commanded a
newly opened air school in the Philippines. Lahm had trouble finding
enough officers to train, so Corporal Vernon L. Burge, Lahm’s crew chief, volunteered and received his pilot's license in June 1912. He is recognized as
the first American enlisted pilot, one of only a handful of World War I
enlisted aviators. After 10 years as an enlisted man, Burge was
commissioned during World War I and served the next 25 years as an
officer. Frank Scott

Father of Blind Flight, William C. Ocker. Sergeant William C. Ocker
entered the U.S. Army on 25 June 1898. He served in the SpanishAmerican and Philippine-American Wars with cavalry and artillery units. After requesting a transfer, on 20 April 1914 he officially joined Burge
(the first enlisted pilot) and Lamkey (the second enlisted pilot) as the third
enlisted pilot. During World War I, while instructing other pilots, Ocker
addressed the hazards of flying into clouds, which invariably disoriented
pilots. He developed a flight integrator, an electrically-driven gyroscope
with a moving background scroll that depicted a sky with clouds and a
miniature airplane silhouette that remained correctly oriented relative to the horizon. In June
1930, Ocker flew approximately 900 miles from San Antonio, Texas to Scott Field, Illinois in an
enclosed cockpit, earning him recognition as the “Father of Blind Flight.” In January 1955, the
USAF posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit to Ocker for the many lives saved during World
War II as a result of the training devices he pioneered. William C. Ocker
### Aviation Section, Signal Corps (18 July 1914 – 20 May 1918)
On 18 July 1914, with the passage of U.S. House Resolution 5304, the bill authorized the Signal
Corps to establish an aviation section. This new launch pad for aviation was officially designated
as Aviation Section, Signal Corps, consisting of 60 officers and 260 enlisted men. The bill created
an official military rating for the aviation mechanician, which called for a 50 percent pay increase
for enlisted men who were instructed in the art of flying while on flying status. The total number
of personnel was limited to 40, with no more than twelve enlisted men authorized by law, but it
was a major breakthrough for enlisted aviators. The Aviation Section was a significant step toward
establishing the Army Air Service. 2.5. Mexican Revolution and the Pancho Villa Expedition
During the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920, Francisco “Pancho” Villa’s forces raided
Columbus, New Mexico. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1st Aero Squadron to
assist ground forces in protecting the border and apprehending Pancho Villa. Commanded by
Captain Benjamin Foulois, 11 pilot officers, 82 enlisted men, and one civilian mechanic departed
from San Antonio, Texas with eight Curtiss JN-3 Jennies, 10 trucks, and one automobile. On the
way, Foulois picked up two enlisted hospital corpsmen and an engineering section consisting of
one officer and 14 enlisted. Despite the 1st Aero Squadron’s successful reconnaissance flights and
several dispatches, mountain weather, dust, extreme temperatures, and the 5,000-feet elevations of
the Casa Grandes in Chihuahua, Mexico wreaked havoc with the aircraft. Within one month, only
two of the eight airplanes were in working condition. In February, after almost a year of what was commonly referred to as the Punitive Expedition, the
pursuit of Pancho Villa was called off. Villa continued to lead rebels in Northern Mexico until
## when he successfully negotiated with the Mexican interim President for amnesty in exchange
for a peace settlement on behalf of himself and his military. Captain Foulois commended his pilots
for their bravery and their willingness to fly clearly dangerous aircraft. He also praised the enlisted
personnel for their dedication and willingness to workday and night to keep the aircraft flying. Valuable lessons were learned about the realities of aviation under field conditions. Adequate
maintenance was essential, as were plenty of backup aircraft while other airplanes were removed
from the line and repaired. <!-- Page 30 -->

A Man of Many Firsts, Benjamin D. Foulois. After enlisting in the Army at
the time of the Spanish-American War, and being commissioned during his
service in the Philippines, Benjamin D. “Benny” Foulois was assigned to the
Office of the Chief Signal Officer, Washington D.C. in 1908, where he
participated in the acceptance tests of the Army’s first semi-rigid dirigible and
its first airplane, the Wright Flyer, Signal Corps No. 1. In 1910, he took the
aircraft to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where he conducted tests to demonstrate
the aircraft’s military usefulness. After completing the organization of the
1st Aero Squadron, Foulois commanded the Pancho Villa Expedition, and after the United States entered World War I, Foulois played a major role in planning and
implementing the $640 million aviation program. In 1917, Brigadier General Foulois was named
Chief of the Air Service for the American Expeditionary Force, moved to Washington, D.C. in
## to become Assistant Chief of the Air Service, and in 1931 was promoted to Major General
as Chief of the Air Corps. Benjamin Foulois

### Air Power in World War I
The Allies, often referred to as Entente Powers, initially consisted of three entities in 1907: the
French Republic, the British Empire, and the Russian Empire. Eventually Italy and Japan joined
the side of the Entente, as well as Belgium, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, and Romania. The Central
Powers on the opposing side, often referred to as the Quadruple Alliance, included the German
Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The lines were
drawn by the time World War I began in July 1914, just days after Archduke Franz Ferdinand of
Austria was assassinated by Yugoslav forces in Sarajevo. By 8 December 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron consisted of 15 officers, 61 enlisted men, 8 aircraft, 16 tractors, and 6 motorcycles. By 1916, a second squadron and new training facilities were added
with plans for 24 more squadrons with a dozen aircraft each. All 24 squadrons were formed by early
1917, but only the 1st Aero Squadron was fully equipped, manned, and organized when the United
States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. The U.S. Army Aviation Section inventory
included less than 250 airplanes and consisted of 131 officers (virtually all pilots or pilots-intraining), and 1,087 enlisted men. Tradition dictated that pilots were drawn from the ranks of commissioned officers, but the Aviation
Section realized the pressing need for trained enlisted personnel to perform duties in supply and
construction and to serve specialized functions in the emerging aviation-related fields of photoreconnaissance, communication, armament, welding, rigging, sail making, and most of all, mechanics. By November 1918, billions of dollars were spent, and over 70 million lives were lost. Battles ensued with victories and defeats of what some refer to as devastation, while others refer
to as a revolutionary approach to military power. 2.7. The First Air War
Aircraft and aerial warfare evolved during World War I between 1914 and 1918. Observation, artillery spotting, and reconnaissance emerged as the airplane’s most important wartime missions. By 1915, pursuit aircraft were developed to deny the enemy use of airspace. While flying missions
evolved from information gathering to defense, using handguns to take down enemy aircraft left
much to be desired. One of the most remarkable advancements in aviation technology was the
arming of aircraft with machine guns that fired between the propeller blades. Using the deflector
blade concept, French pilot, Roland Garros, attached steel plates to the propeller of his MoraneSaulnier Type L monoplane, enabling him to fire through the propeller arc of his aircraft. This
innovative process enabled Garros to achieve the first aerial victory in history. Note: When engine
trouble forced Garros to land behind enemy lines on 19 April 1915, the Germans captured him as
a prisoner of war, but also studied the innovative concepts on his aircraft and created the first true
fighter plane, the Fokker Eindecker, which was used ferociously on allied aircraft. Flying Aces. The concept of the ace emerged in 1915 during World War I at the same time as
aerial dogfighting. A flying ace or “ace” is a military aviator credited with shooting down multiple
enemy aircraft during aerial combat. Initially five or more aerial victories were required to be
considered an ace, but that number varies throughout history. Public sentiment for the ace was
based on a sense of pride and patriotism for war heroes in the skies. Allies and adversaries alike
publicized aces to foster public support for the war effort. While aces are generally thought of
<!-- Page 32 -->

32
exclusively as fighter pilots, enlisted aviators also earned the coveted title. Aerial gunners and
observers, for example, were often referred to as aces for executing air-to-air victories on the
enemy. Ace of Aces, Edward V. Rickenbacker. Captain Edward V. “Fast Eddie”
Rickenbacker served in the U.S. Army Air Service from 1917 to 1919 and
has been highly regarded as the most successful fighter ace in World War I. With 26 confirmed aerial victories, Rickenbacker became known as
America’s “Ace of Aces” and held the American record for victories until
World War II. He is considered to have received the most awards for valor, received the Distinguished Service Cross a record of eight times, and in
1930, one of his Service Crosses was converted to the Medal of Honor. Edward V. Rickenbacker
The Lafayette Escadrille. As early as 1915, Americans flew in the European war, both with the
French and the British—though it was the American-manned Lafayette Escadrille of France that
earned the greatest and most enduring fame. Named in honor of Marquis de Lafayette, Hero of the
Two Worlds, the French Air Service established the Lafayette Escadrille in 1916. In 1918, American members of the Lafayette Escadrille transferred into the U.S. Army Air Service as the
103d Aero Squadron while the French formed the Escadrille Jeanne d’Arc. First African American Military Pilot, Eugene Bullard. Corporal Eugene
Bullard is one of the very few enlisted Americans to fly in the war, and the
first African American military pilot. Bullard enlisted in 1914 and was
assigned to the 3rd Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion. In World War
I, Bullard flew as a machine gunner and served in over 20 air combat
missions. As a member of the French Foreign Legion, he was awarded the
French Croix de Guerre. He was wounded four times before the legion gave
him a disability discharge. During his convalescence in Paris, he bet an
American $2,000 that he could learn to fly and become a combat aviator. Corporal Bullard won the bet by completing training and joining the
Lafayette Escadrille. Referred to as “The Black Swallow of Death,” he
claimed two victories. 2.8. Division of Military Aeronautics (20 May 1918 – 24 May 1918)
Eugene Bullard
On 20 May 1918, President Wilson issued an Executive Order that transferred Army aviation
control from the Signal Corps to the Secretary of War. This four-day transition existed long enough
for the reorganization to take place and officially transfer recognition of responsibilities of aviation
administration, assets, and personnel from the division of military aeronautics to the Air Service. 2.9. Air Service, U.S. Army (24 May 1918 – 2 July 1926)
The U.S. Army Air Service was established in 1918 as a temporary branch of the U.S. War
Department and was faced with budget cutbacks and resistance to establishing an independent Air
Force. A drawdown was enacted in 1918 that called for a reduction in Air Service personnel from
190,000 to fewer than 20,000. Likewise, the $952 million allocated for military aviation in 1919
fell to $28 million in 1920. Another challenge came about when Congress demanded that new
military aircraft use the surplus Liberty engines produced during the World War I buildup. Consequently, World War I vintage Curtiss JN-3 Jennies and Liberty DH-4 bombers remained in
service until the 1930s, despite technological advances that had been made in airframe and engine
design. <!-- Page 33 -->

Father of the USAF, William Mitchell. After enlisting, joining the
Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, and taking private flying lessons, William “Billy” Mitchell earned his private pilot’s license. He was
convinced of airpower’s potential as the primary component of national
defense against strategic bombardment and was a strong advocate for an
independent Air Force. Mitchell’s claims ultimately led to bombing trials
in June 1921. Under his leadership, the 1st Provisional Air Brigade sank
the 27,000-ton former German battleship Ostfriesland. Officials turned
over two World War I battleships for further testing, the United States
Ship (USS) New Jersey and the USS Virginia, to punctuate the values of
airpower. At the age of 32, Captain Mitchell was the youngest member to
join the General Staff. For his efforts, Mitchell earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the
Distinguished Service Medal, the World War I Victory Medal with eight campaign clasps, and
several foreign decorations. Note: In 1924, Mitchell developed a 324-page report that predicted
a future war with Japan, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. Mitchell believed a surprise attack
on the Hawaiian Islands would be conducted by land- based aircraft operating from islands in the
Pacific. His report was published as the book Winged Defense in 1925, about sixteen years prior
to the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan in 1941. William Mitchell
selected
to demonstrate
Demonstration of Airpower, Ulysses Nero. A young bombardier, Sergeant Ulysses “Sam” Nero, was
the
capabilities of
airpower. Against established tactics, during the
demonstration Nero and the Martin-Curtiss NBS-1 pilot approached the
USS New Jersey at 85 miles per hour at an altitude of 6,900 feet, from
about 15 degrees off the port beam. They scored two hits, and the USS
New Jersey went down in just over three minutes. Having one bomb left, Nero’s aircraft proceeded to the floundering USS Virginia to administer
the coup de grace on the stricken craft—the shot landed directly on the
Virginia’s deck, putting it out of commission permanently. General
Mitchell disqualified Nero and his pilot from further competition for
disobeying instructions, but he reconsidered when the rest of the crews failed to hit the USS
Virginia unless they dropped down to 1,500 feet. Nero was promoted during the next cycle. Note: The NBS in Martin-Curtis NBS-1 is an abbreviation for night bomber-short range. Ulysses Nero
End of the Enlisted Pilot Era and George H. Holmes. George H. Holmes
served in the Navy during World War I. After the war, he enlisted in the Army
in 1919 as a mechanic. In 1921 Holmes became a pilot flying the Curtiss JN4D Jenny and other aircraft. When World War II ended, Lieutenant Colonel
Holmes chose to revert back to his enlisted rank. Ending the era of enlisted
pilots, Master Sergeant George H. Holmes was the last of about 2,500 men
who graduated from enlisted pilot training. When he retired from the Air
Force in 1957, he was the last of the enlisted pilots. George H. Holmes
World War I Armistice. Airpower clearly played an important role in the Allied victory of World
War I. As of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, observation, reconnaissance, and artillery
spotting remained significant missions, but close air support, interdiction, and strategic
bombardment showed promise in the progress of airpower. Armistice Day may best be known as
the signing of an agreement to end the war in the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day, of the eleventh
month. Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was
signed in 1919 and many of the troops serving abroad finally returned to their home countries. In

the United States, Armistice is publicly recognized on Veterans Day in honor of military veterans. 2.10. U.S. Army Air Corps (2 July 1926 – 20 June 1941)
The U.S. Army Air Corps was established as a step toward recognizing the autonomy of aviation
and its role in modern warfare. During this time, aviation was still a part of the U.S. Army
command structure. Meanwhile, the Air Corps Tactical School and Air Corps Technical School
evolved under the U.S. Army Air Corps. Air Corps Tactical School. Through a brief series of changes, in 1926 the Air Service Tactical
School, designed for military officer professional development, was renamed the Air Corps
Tactical School. Eventually the Air Corps Tactical School was relocated to Maxwell Field, Alabama, where it was later replaced as the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics. The school
is now recognized as the Air University, and remains on Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Air Corps Technical School. In 1926, the Air Corps Technical School was established at Chanute
Field, Illinois. While other branches of the Army returned to the apprentice system of assignment
and training, the Army Air Corps continued to use and develop a combination of the Army Alpha
Test (reading and writing assessment), aptitude tests, and counseling. At the technical school, students participated in a range of experimental work, including altitude flights, blind flying, aerial
photography, cosmic ray research, and the development of the parachute. Enlisted men who
wanted to apply for technical training had to qualify as high school graduates, or the equivalent, and pass a mathematics proficiency test in addition to the Army Alpha Test. A trade test specialist
familiar with the actual work personally interviewed each enlisted man. By 1938, the technical
school branched out to Lowry Field, Colorado and Scott Field, Illinois. Aerial Refueling and Carl A. Spaatz. General Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz, first Chief of Staff of the Air Force, was a member of the Fokker C-2
aircrew that launched the legendary Question Mark mission on 1 January
## to showcase aerial refueling potential. The mission was simple, determine how long the aircrew could keep the aircraft in the air. The crew
flew the Question Mark for 150 hours and 40 minutes, taking on 5,600
gallons of hand-pumped fuel during 37 air-to-air refuelings. They traveled
11,000 miles on that journey, proving the relatively unlimited range
available with air refueling capabilities. Carl A. Spaatz
Operation Point Blank and Ira C. Eaker. General Ira C. Eaker was
an aviation pioneer and articulate advocate of aerospace power. Commissioned in the Army Reserve after graduating flight school, he
participated in the Pan-American Good Will Flight of 1926 and 1927, which is displayed at the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, Ohio. Eaker also flew in the legendary Question Mark extended aerial
refueling mission in 1929. As a strong advocate for daylight strategic
bombardment, during Operation Point Blank, Eaker directed the
daylight campaigns while the British conducted their night area
bombing. The co-led operation struck the German military and industrial base of Nazioccupied territories around the clock, exhausting German strength, as well as its production
capabilities. Ira C. Eaker
### General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force (1935 – 1939)
Alongside the Army Air Corps, GHQ Air Force was set up to focus primarily on control of
aviation combat units, while still being aligned under the Army Air Corps. This was a confusing
<!-- Page 35 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
35
half-step toward an independent Air Force but proved to be the right direction for the conception
of airpower. GHQ Air Force was established with the recognition that technological advances in
aircraft would eventually propel airpower forward as a significant military force, beyond its early
role of solely supporting ground troops. In 1938, when the United States first took the signs of
war in Europe seriously, the Army’s Air Arm was still split into two cumbersome command
organizations, the Army Air Corps and GHQ Air Force. In 1939, President Roosevelt asked for
an appropriation of $300 million for military aviation. Before the outbreak of hostilities in Europe
in the fall of 1939, GHQ Air Force had begun the massive expansion program that eventually
evolved into the largest air organization in the nation’s history. 2.12. U.S. Army Air Forces (20 June 1941 – 17 September 1947)
The U.S. Army Air Forces was established in June 1941. It replaced both the U.S. Army Air Corps
and the GHQ Air Force. Although still under command of the Army, the message was clear, unify
command of all air elements, give total autonomy to air forces, and provide equality separate from
ground forces. The U.S. Army Air Forces continued to exist as a branch of the Army (similar to
the infantry, quartermaster, or artillery) until reorganization provisions of the Public Law 80-495, National Security Act of 1947, 18 September 1947. Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces, Henry H. Arnold. General Henry H. “Hap” Arnold was an aviation pioneer, a West Point
graduate, and an infantryman. In 1911 he was taught to fly by Orville and
Wilbur Wright. Arnold began his rise through the Army Air Corps during
the interwar years, serving in Air Service Headquarters and in several of the
most important operational flying commands in the field. After serving two
years as the Chief of the Air Corps, in June 1941 he became Commanding
General of the U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II. Under General
Arnold’s command, the force expanded to nearly 2.5 million members and
75,000 aircraft. Henry H. Arnold

### Airpower in World War II
Allied Powers that existed at the onset of World War II in 1939 consisted of a long list of countries: France, Poland, the United Kingdom, British India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South
Africa. Soon, the Balkans, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, and Yugoslavia joined the alliance as
well. By 1942, the countries emerged as the United Nations, and brought the United States, Russia, and China onboard to stop the Axis Powers. The Axis Powers consisted of Germany, Japan, and
Italy. If World War I signaled airpower’s promise, World War II fulfilled the vision. In every
aspect of aerial combat, airpower served as a force multiplier. Air superiority proved to be a
prerequisite for successful land, sea, and air operations. 2.14. Ramping Up
Recognizing the need for a robust national defense, in 1940 President Franklin D. Roosevelt called
for American industry to build 50,000 military aircraft a year in preparation for defending our
nation’s interests. That same year, Congress passed the first peacetime conscription law in United
States history, mandating that all able-bodied men join the service. At the time, the U.S. Army Air
Corps inventory was merely 1,700 tactical and training aircraft, 1,600 Air Corps officers, and
18,000 enlisted men. The Air Corps planned for 24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941, which called for greatly enhanced manpower, training, and equipment. Although American
industry was ready to move forward with production, aeronautical designs, blueprints, tools, dies, airframes, engines, factories, skilled workers, and countless other components of an aviation
industry, they would require time to develop. On 7 December 1941, “a date which will live in infamy,” Imperial Japan dealt a devastating blow
to the United States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii by sinking or heavily damaging several military
battleships in two waves of approximately 350 Japanese aircraft. Also, our military aircraft made
prime targets for Japanese aviators as they continued their attack that same day by destroying an
entire fleet refueling on the ground in the Philippines. On 8 December 1941, the United States
declared war on Japan. Three days later, we were at war with Germany and Italy as allies of Japan. Despite the fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor was what formally brought the United States into
the war, the war in Europe and the defeat of Germany would take precedence. Reflecting on 1930s Air Corps Tactical School doctrine of using massive force to destroy the
enemy’s will and capability to fight through long-range strategic bombardment, by 1942 American
factories produced 33,304 aircraft, and by 1944 the inventory rose to 72,726. Also, by March 1944
Air Force manpower reached over two million. During the war, the majority of enlisted Airmen
served in roles that never took them into the air, but without their efforts, no bombs would have
dropped, and no war could have been waged. Considering all the support personnel in the Army
Air Corps, the ratio of Airmen to aircraft was about 27 to 1. American industrial production, strategic target bombing, new tactics, enhanced training, greater budgets, and new aircraft with
greater range, speed, and maneuverability, all proved to be key factors to an Allied victory. 2.15. Prohibition of Discrimination
Executive Orders 8802 and 9981. In 1941, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, prohibiting racial discrimination within the services. Civil rights activists saw promise for
desegregation with Executive Order 8802, requiring vocational and training programs to be
<!-- Page 37 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
37
administered without discrimination for race, creed, color, or national origin. The order made
progress but did not end segregation. When the USAF became a distinct service in 1947, segregation policies restricted black Airmen to all-black units or segregated service squadrons. In
1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 to abolish racial discrimination. On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 was published, mandating that black Airmen be reassigned
to formerly all-white units according to qualifications. The Tuskegee Airmen. In 1944, the first Tuskegee Airmen to
fight in World War II were members of the 99th Fighter
Squadron, a unit commanded by black West Point graduate, Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. Soon after battling German
aircraft over the skies of Anzio, Italy in their P-40 aircraft, they
were joined by a second Tuskegee unit, the 332d Fighter Group
with their P-39s. The Tuskegee Airmen’s obsolete aircraft were
replaced later that year by P-47s and P-51s respectively, and the
crews flew bomber escort missions until the German surrender
in the spring of 1945. The Tuskegee Airmen
By the end of World War II, nearly 1,000 black Americans had proudly and rightfully earned their
wings. The Tuskegee Airmen destroyed 112 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, losing 66 of their
own aircraft. As a tribute to their skill, courage, and determination, the Tuskegee Airmen amassed
a distinguished combat record on their 312 escort missions into Germany. The Tuskegee Airmen’s
actions in the skies over North Africa, the Mediterranean, Sicily, Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, France, Romania, and Germany dispelled myths, rewrote history, and prepared the USAF for
being the first of the U.S. Armed Services to integrate racially. First African American General in the U.S. Air Force, Benjamin
o. Davis, Jr. General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. was the commander of
the famed World War II Tuskegee Airmen. He was also the son of
General Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., the first black General in the U.S. Army. Davis graduated from West Point in 1936 and was
commissioned as an infantry officer. He was a Reserve Officer
Training Corp instructor at Tuskegee Institute from 1938 to 1941 and
became one of the first African Americans admitted to pilot training. In 1970, Davis retired as the senior African American officer in the
U.S. Armed Forces. Upon retirement he organized a special force of sky marshals to help combat
aircraft hijacking, and in July 1971 he was appointed as Assistant Secretary of Transportation, where he remained until he retired in 1975. On 8 December 1998, in a ceremony at the White
House, President William J. Clinton promoted Davis to the rank of four-star general. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. The First American Volunteer Group. In early 1941, the first American Volunteer Group, known as the Flying Tigers, was organized to reinforce Nationalist China’s efforts against
Japanese invaders. Recruited under U.S. Presidential authority and led by Captain Claire Lee
Chennault (who eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant General), the Flying Tigers included
pilots from the U.S. Army Air Corps, U.S. Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as a few civilians. The group of volunteers were officially members of the Chinese Air Force and had contracts with
salaries ranging from $250 a month for mechanics to $750 for squadron commanders, roughly
three times what they had been making previously. <!-- Page 38 -->

The three Flying Tigers squadrons, consisting of the Adam & Eves, Panda Bears, and Hell's Angels, maintained around 30 aircraft each. The shark-faced nose art of the Flying Tigers remains among the
most recognizable image of any individual combat aircraft or
combat unit of World War II. The American Volunteer Group was
credited with destroying almost 300 enemy aircraft but lost 14
pilots in combat. In the book, Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and
His American Volunteers, 1941–1942, the author, Daniel Ford, attributes the American Volunteer Group’s success to morale and
group esprit de corps. He notes that the pilots were triple volunteers
who had volunteered for service with the United States military, the
American Volunteer Group, and engaged in brutal fighting in Burma. They were clearly a corps
of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight. On 4 July 1942, the Flying Tigers
were disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces. The First American
Volunteer Group
Enlisted Pilot Training Program. In June 1941, Congress passed Public Law 99, which
authorized an enlisted pilot training program. The law permitted enlisted men between ages 18
and 25 who graduated in the top half of their high school class to apply. By contrast, aviation
cadets had to have two years of college and be at least 21 years old. Class 42-C, the first class of
“flying sergeants” graduated as enlisted pilots on 7 March 1942. One half graduated from Kelly
Field, Texas and the other half graduated from Ellington Field, Texas. All of Class 42-C went on
to fly P-38s. Subsequent classes were assigned to various types of aircraft in both combat and
support units. Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps. The Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was created in May 1942
and within a year became the Women’s Army Corps, which was essentially the women’s branch
of the U.S. Army. Women served with distinction, replacing men who could then be reassigned to
combat and other vital duties. What initially began with 800 women in training, eventually rose to
150,000 during World War II. A top priority assignment for women was to serve at aircraft warning
service stations. Many others were assigned as clerical and administrative assistants, topographers, medical specialists, chemists, and even aircraft mechanics. Greatest Female Aviator of All Time, Jacqueline Cochran. Jacqueline Cochran is remembered for competing in and winning
several flying events and performing record-breaking missions
with regard to altitude, distance, and speed. During World War II, Cochran organized efforts for 25 women to fly for Great Britain
and she was the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic
Ocean. In 1943, she was appointed to the U.S. Army Air Forces
and served as Director of the Women’s Air Force Service Pilots
Training Program. Colonel Cochran received the Distinguished
Service Medal for her service. In 1971, she was inducted into the
National Aviation Hall of Fame. Her efforts helped her earn titles, such as “the most outstanding
woman pilot in the world” and “the greatest female aviator of all time.” In 1975, Cochran was the
first woman to be honored with a permanent display of her memorabilia at the USAF Academy. Jacqueline Cochran

Most Decorated Woman in United States Military History, Lillian K. Keil. A pioneer in passenger care, Captain Lillian K. Keil successfully
combined two careers (flight attendant and flight nurse) to become the
most decorated woman in our military history. Keil was one of the first
stewardesses hired by United Airlines when the United States entered
World War II. She later served in the U.S. Army Air Forces and treated
wounded and frostbitten crewmen after bombing raids over Europe. During World War II, Keil made 250 evacuation flights, 23 of which
were transatlantic. After World War II, Keil returned to United Airlines as
an assistant chief stewardess. In 1950, she was called back to duty as a
flight nurse during the Korean War, amassing 175 air evacuations and logging 1,400 flying hours. Overall, it is estimated she attended to more than 10,000 wounded. She was awarded 19 medals, including a European Theater Medal with 4 Battle Stars, a Korean Service Medal with 7 Battle
Stars, 4 Air Medals, and a Presidential Citation from the Republic of Korea. Lillian Keil
### Nazi Suppression
Operation Argument. Armed with new aircraft, tactics, and superior numbers, Operation
Argument, otherwise known as Big Week, was launched with the objective of winning air
superiority and crippling Germany’s aircraft industry. The operation consisted of a series of attacks
aimed against Nazi Germany from 20 - 25 February 1944. During this time, the 8th Air Force flew
3,300 heavy bomber sorties, the 15th Air Force added 500 missions from Italy, and the Royal Air
Force Bomber Command flew 2,750 night attacks aimed at German aircraft manufacturing plants. Nearly 4,000 fighter sorties were conducted as protective measures for operational assets. At a
cost of 226 American bombers, 114 British heavies, and 28 U.S. Army Air Force fighters, Operation Argument damaged or destroyed an estimated 500 Luftwaffe fighters and killed 400
pilots. Invasion of Normandy. Although the Luftwaffe managed to replace many downed aircraft, it
could not replace the 2,262 experienced pilots killed in the five months preceding the invasion of
Normandy. By 6 June 1944, Allied Air Forces dominated the skies of Europe. On the first day of
the invasion, widely recognized as D-Day, the Allies directed 8,722 U.S. Army Air Force and
5,676 Royal Air Force sorties against German defenses in France. In response, the Luftwaffe
launched fewer than 100 sorties and only two German aircraft inflicted damage on the invasion
beaches. Clearly, Allied bombers and fighters trumped the German integrated air defense network. Combined Bomber Offensive. After the Normandy invasion, the Combined Bomber Offensive
devastated Germany’s forces. From 1942 to 1945, the Combined Bomber Offensive was the
longest, bloodiest air campaign in history. According to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, the
Allies flew 1.44 million combat sorties and dropped 2.7 million tons of bombs. These missions
killed and wounded over a million Germans and destroyed 3.6 million buildings. Inevitably, with
the loss of over twenty percent of its forces, the Third Reich surrendered in May 1945 and General
Spaatz declared a strategic air war victory against Germany. It was clear that airpower had emerged
as a dominant weapon in Western Europe during World War II. Operation Chowhound. In conjunction with the British humanitarian mission referred to as
Operation Mana, in May 1945 the U.S. Army Air Forces delivered four thousand tons of food to
three million Dutch in the German-occupied Netherlands during Operation Chowhound. Ten
groups of B-17 bombers flew 2,268 sorties, avoiding German anti-aircraft attacks and suffering
minimal losses. <!-- Page 40 -->

Notable Bravery and First Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Paul
w. Airey. In 1944, at the age of 20, Technical Sergeant Paul W. Airey and his fellow crewmen were shot down on their 28th mission
outside of Vienna, Austria. He was held as a prisoner of war for 10 months, surviving a 90- day, 400-mile march from the Baltic Sea to Berlin before
being liberated by the British Army in 1945. During the Korean War, Airey
served as a radio repairman. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for saving
more than a million dollars in electronic equipment that would have
deteriorated without the corrosion control assembly line he developed. Airey became the first Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in 1967. Notably, in 1988, Chief Airey received the Air Force Prisoner of War Medal. Paul W. Airey
B-17 Named in his Honor, Sator Sanchez. Enlisted personnel served with
honor throughout World War II. Sergeant Sator “Smilin’ Sandy” Sanchez
flew 44 missions as an aerial gunner with the 95th Bomb Group, 19 more
missions than required to complete his tour. After returning home for a brief
period, rather than accepting an assignment as a gunnery instructor, he
returned to Europe. Flying with the 353d Bombardment Squadron in Italy, Sanchez’s aircraft was hit by ground fire. Nine of the 10-member crew bailed
out successfully, but Sanchez never made it from the stricken aircraft. The
raid against the last operational Nazi oil refinery on 15 March 1945 was
successful, but it cost the life of one of the enlisted force’s most decorated
Airmen. Sanchez was the only enlisted Airman to have a B-17 named in his honor. Sator Sanchez
### World War II Japanese Forces
The Doolittle Raid. The Japanese forces appeared invincible during the first six months of conflict
in World War II. However, on 18 April 1942, Lieutenant Colonel James H. “Jimmy” Doolittle led
## North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, launching from the carrier USS Hornet in a
bombing raid on military targets in Tokyo, Kobe, and Nagoya, Japan. While the Doolittle Raid
inflicted little damage on Japanese efforts, and unfortunately destroyed almost the entire fleet of
its own B-25s, the gesture shocked Japanese military leaders and boosted morale for the American
public. Notable Bravery and Doolittle Raider, James Doolittle. General James
h. “Jimmy” Doolittle’s professional accomplishments are legendary. He
was an air leader, aeronautical engineer, airplane racer, businessman, commanding general, oil-company executive, special assistant to the
Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and holder of the Medal of Honor. In
1922, Lieutenant Doolittle flew 21 hours and 19 minutes across the
United States in a DH-4, with one refueling stop. In 1925, he won the
Schneider Trophy in an over–water seaplane race when he established a
world seaplane record at 245.713 miles per hour. In 1929, he was
awarded the Harmon Trophy for being the first pilot to take off, fly a set
course, and land using instruments alone. After a break in service, he
returned to lead the 18 April 1942 Doolittle Raid on Japan. In 1985, U.S. Congress promoted
Doolittle to four-star general, the first person in the Air Force Reserve’s history to be promoted to
that rank. James H. Doolittle

### Atomic Era
With great power comes great responsibility. Stemming as far back as 1896, when uranium was
discovered to release an ‘unknown’ radiation, and radioactivity was related to the possibilities of
atomic energy, the atomic era had begun. The potential uses for atomic energy ranged from nuclear
medicine to fuel to weaponry. It wasn’t until 1945 that the use of atomic energy was used as a
nuclear weapon with the intention of putting an end to World War II. In July 1945, following a successful atomic test of the first nuclear bomb, Trinity, the Allied
Powers issued an ultimatum calling for the Japanese government to surrender or suffer “prompt
and utter destruction.” Within a matter of weeks, specially modified B-29s delivered the first
operational atomic bombs. On 6 August 1945, the B-29, Enola Gay dropped a uranium bomb
known as “Little Boy” over Hiroshima. Nearly five square miles of the city were destroyed, and
80,000 people were killed. Three days later, on 9 August 1945, the B-29, Bockscar, released a
plutonium bomb called “Fat Man” on Nagasaki. Approximately 1.5 square miles were destroyed, 60,000 people were severely injured, and 35,000 people were killed. Faced with defeated military
forces, burned cities, and a declaration of war by the Soviet Union, the Japanese government
surrendered on 14 August 1945. The use of atomic weapons of mass destruction proved to be an
effective force in inflicting devastation on an enemy. Note: By June 1946, a United Nationsappointed commission completed a plan for the elimination of nuclear weaponry. It was proposed
that inspectors would travel the globe to ensure no country was making atomic bombs, and to
supervise the dismantling of existing weapons. Unfortunately, that plan was vetoed by the Soviet
Union, resulting in almost five decades of the Cold War. 2.19. Entering the Cold War
In 1945, British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill; Soviet Premier, Josef Stalin; and American
President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, met to discuss the postwar division of Europe. The meeting did
not go well, but it was foundational for the establishment of the United Nations. Although the
United States and our Western Allies had counted on the Soviet Union as a heroic nation struggling
with them against Hitler, it was apparent even before World War II ended that the alliance would
not survive the ideological gulf that separated capitalist democracies from the communist giant. After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union aimed at increasing their ideologies
and influences throughout the world. <!-- Page 42 -->

The United States space program originated from the seminal experiments of American engineer
Robert H. Goddard, whose ideas and early designs were further refined by the rocketry
advancements of Nazi Germany. In 1944, after eight years of research, German scientists
successfully launched the world’s first Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile, the V-2 rocket. This
nascent threat of attack from hundreds of miles away made it clear that future warfare would not
be limited to only land, sea, and sky. At the conclusion of World War II, almost 1,600 of the Nazi’s leading scientists, engineers, and
technicians, under the direction of German scientist Wernher von Braun, surrendered to allied
forces and were secretly moved to the United States. During the ensuing of the Cold War with the
Soviet Union, they continued their groundbreaking work throughout the 1950s under the
supervision of the United States Army, eventually laying the foundation for American ballistic
missile technology, satellite development, and later, manned space missions. Following the war, Major General Curtis E. LeMay, then Deputy Chief of the Air Staff for
Research and Development, envisioned space operations to be an extension of air operations. In
1946, he tasked the Research and Development Corporation to propose a preliminary design for
an experimental world-circling spaceship - what would later be known as satellites. In late 1953, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development convened a
group of experts known as the Strategic Missiles Evaluation Group, code named the Teapot
Committee, to examine the field of long-range missiles and accelerate intercontinental ballistic
missile development. Based on the committee’s recommendations, Air Research and Development
Command established the Western Development Division to develop and field test intercontinental
ballistic missiles. On 2 August 1954, Brigadier General Bernard Schriever assumed command of
the new organization. 2.21. The Space Race
While the focus of the late 1940s was the pursuit of rocket research and upper atmospheric sciences
as a means of assuring American leadership in technology, a major step forward came when
President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a plan to orbit a scientific satellite as part of the
International Geophysical Year (IGY). IGY was a cooperative effort to gather scientific data about
the Earth for the period of 1 July 1957 to 31 December 1958. On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the Sputnik I satellite into earth orbit. The Soviet success marked the beginning of the space age and sparked the space race between the
United States and the Soviet Union. In response to the Sputnik I launch, President Dwight D. Eisenhower accelerated civil and military space efforts, a decision that would prove crucial
throughout the Cold War. To counter the threat of a possible Soviet nuclear attack, President
Eisenhower made development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) a national priority. By the end of the decade, the Air Force accepted its first long-range Atlas ICBM, followed later
by the Titan system. In 1958, the Air Force developed plans for a manned military presence in space, but President
Eisenhower reserved manned missions for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

(NASA). However, the Air Force’s plan formed the basis of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo
Programs. The Space Transportation System, commonly known as the Space Shuttle, was born
out of a desire by NASA to ferry astronauts to large space stations and a desire of the Air Force to
put military astronauts into space. 2.22. Maximizing Space Effects
Concurrent with efforts to develop long-range missiles, the United States pursued space-based
technology to reveal credible information on Soviet military intentions and capabilities. Following
the recommendation of the Research and Development Corporation’s “Project Feedback” Report, senior Air Force leaders issued Weapon System Requirement No. 5, directing the development of
an electro-optical reconnaissance satellite. This new era of space-based platforms was eventually
broadened to include other missions such as missile warning, space awareness, and battlespace
characterization. To support these new technologies, the Air Force developed the ground-based infrastructure to
support, augment, and complement the space-based portions of satellite systems. Ground-based
systems included the ballistic missile early warning system, space object surveillance, and the Air
Force Satellite Control Network. In addition, the Air Force developed launch ranges necessary to
get satellites into space – one at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the other at Vandenberg Air Force
Base, California. Now under the direction of the United States Space Force, these launch bases
provide support not only for Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored systems, but also for the
NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and additional commercial enterprises. 2.23. Space Reconnaissance
In 1960 the National Reconnaissance Office was formed to take charge of highly classified
reconnaissance satellites. President Eisenhower undertook several initiatives to help prevent a
surprise nuclear attack against the United States, including establishing the classified Satellite
Photo Reconnaissance Program, code named Corona. This system, known publicly as the
Discoverer Research Program, achieved its first successful launch of the Discoverer XIII on 10
August 1960. This early success acquired over 3,000 feet of reconnaissance film from space, heralding the beginning of America’s space-based photo reconnaissance capability. The Air Force concentrated on unmanned missions to fulfill national security needs. Space
reconnaissance satellites, for instance, supported strategic deterrence throughout the Cold War, providing invaluable knowledge of the Soviet Union’s nuclear inventory and verifying compliance
with weapons control treaties. Space systems provided early warning of ballistic missile attack on
North America and set the stage for worldwide communications platforms for strategic command
and control. Intelligence collected from space remains essential to United States national security. It is
foundational to the formulation of foreign and defense policies, the capacity of the President to
manage crises and conﬂicts, the conduct of military operations, and the development of military
capabilities to assure the attainment of United States objectives. In the early 1990s, space came out of the ‘black world’ of secrecy and into the mainstream military
during the Gulf War. Warfighters in the Gulf, soldiers in the foxholes, cargo aircraft flying people
and equipment, and ships at sea, gained greater access to space-based information. This
information helped military planners see what Saddam Hussein could not see and gave coalition
forces the high ground to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait. <!-- Page 44 -->

### Global Reliance on Space Capabilities
Space-based technology revolutionized major aspects of commercial and social activity and will
continue to do so as the capacity and capabilities of satellites increase through emerging
technologies. Space enters homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, and government ofﬁces through
its applications for transportation, health, the environment, telecommunications, education, commerce, agriculture, and energy. Much like highways and airways, water lines and electric
grids, services supplied from space are already an important part of the United States and global
infrastructures. Commercial space activity has become increasingly important to the global economy. Civil
activity now involves more nations, international consortia, and non-state actors. Space-related
capabilities help national leaders to implement American foreign policy and, when necessary, to
use military power in ways never before possible. Because of space capabilities, the United States
is better able to sustain and extend deterrence to its allies and friends in our highly complex
international environment. In the year 2000, the United States recognized the increasing importance of Global Positioning
System (GPS) to civil and commercial users by discontinuing the deliberate degradation of
accuracy for non-military signals, known as Selective Availability. Since that time, commercial
and civil applications of GPS have continued to multiply, and its importance has increased
significantly. GPS is now a key component of the United States critical infrastructure. Services
that depend on GPS are now an engine for economic growth and improved public safety. 2.25. Space Commission
In January 2001, a commission headed by then United States Defense Secretary-designate, Donald
Rumsfeld, warned about a possible “space Pearl Harbor” in which a potential enemy would launch
a surprise attack against United States-based military space assets, disabling them. The
commission warned, “The United States is more dependent on space than any other nation. Yet
the threat to the United States and its allies in and from space does not command the attention it
merits.”
Recognizing the importance of space to United States national interests, Congress chartered a
review of national security space activities. Released in May 2001, “The Report of the Commission
to Assess United States National Security, Space Management and Organization,” better known
as the Space Commission Report, found that, “The security and economic well-being of the United
States and its allies and friends depend on the nation’s ability to operate successfully in space. To
be able to contribute to peace and stability in a distinctly different, but still dangerous and complex
global environment, the United States needs to remain at the forefront in space, technologically, and operationally, as we have in the air, on land, and at sea. Specifically, the United States must
have the capability to use space as an integral part of its ability to manage crises, deter conflicts, and if deterrence fails, to prevail in conflict.”
### The Ultimate High Ground
Over the last decade, space has become competitive, congested, and contested. The opportunity to
achieve and hold the high ground advantage in space is no longer limited to the United States. Many countries either conduct or participate in space programs dedicated to a variety of tasks, including communications and remote sensing. The United States will continue to be tested over
time by competing programs or attempts to restrict United States space activities. On 11 January 2007, the world received a wake-up call when China conducted its first successful
direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) test by destroying one of its own satellites. While there are
<!-- Page 45 -->

45
long-term political and strategic implications to this test, satellites in low Earth orbit such as
reconnaissance and weather satellites and manned space missions (including the International
Space Station, space shuttle, and China’s manned flights) became vulnerable to the increase in
space debris resulting from China’s satellite destruction. Due to the technical nature of space operations, the broadening diversity of threats and the
complexity of the future battlespace and the development of space systems operations, it is
essential to maintain superiority in the space domain. The space domain and the vertical
environment is increasingly saturated with ‘near space peers.’ Our ability to operate freely through
space, recognize when fighting extends to space, exploit space-based effects at a time and tempo
of our choosing, and dictate the parameters of space access, are all challenged. 2.27. The Space Imperative
To come full circle, General LeMay’s 1946 Research and Development Corporation study
concluded that, “We can see no more clearly all the utility and implications of the space ships
than the Wright Brothers could see fleets of B-29s bombing Japan and air transports circling the
globe.” For the next 70 years, our ability to maneuver to and through space has presented
unlimited potential for prosperity and security, making continued Air Force dominance of the
space domain a national imperative. Throughout the years, space has been a direct contributor to air, land, maritime, and cyberspace
operations (CO). Space operations are conducted in all domains with terrestrial and sea-based
platforms, aboard space lift vehicles, via persistent on-orbit constellations, and across the
electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). That said, in 2017, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson
told Congress that space no longer is just an enabler and force enhancer for United States military
operations, it is a warfighting domain just like air, land, and sea. In 2018, Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein, doubled down in stating it was, “time
for us as a service, regardless of specialty badge, to embrace space superiority with the same
passion and sense of ownership as we apply to air superiority today.” He went on to exclaim, “I
believe we’re going to be fighting from space in a matter of years. And we are the service that
must lead joint war fighting in this new contested domain. This is what the nation demands.”
### The Space Force
On December 20, 2019, Title 10 U.S.C., Ch. 908, U.S. Space Force Act, 1 January 2021, was
signed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act by President Donald Trump. This act
reorganized the Air Force Space Command into the U.S. Space Force and created the first new
independent military service since the Army Air Forces were reorganized as the USAF in 1947. Along with its sister branch, the USAF, the Space Force is part of the Department of the Air
Force, one of the three civilian-led military departments within the Department of Defense. It is
the smallest branch within the U.S. Armed Forces with an active-duty end strength of 8,400 and its
members are called Guardians. The USAF, however, originated the concept of a military space force 70 years before the U.S. Space Force was created when a visionary Air Force general, who was a physician-scientist, created an organization that became vital to the success of NASA’s manned space flight program. Dr. Harry Armstrong, who became the Air Force’s second Surgeon General, built his credibility
as a scientific pioneer upon his earlier contributions to the viability of commercial air travel
through his development of cabin pressurization. Dr. Armstrong did not scientifically subscribe to the old phrase “the sky’s the limit.” He had his
sights set much higher – space travel. He leveraged his position as commander of the USAF School
<!-- Page 46 -->

46
of Aviation Medicine (USAFSAM) to fulfill a dream. He had conceived the idea of building upon
technological advances USAFSAM had made in aviation medicine since its inception in 1918 to
promote the then new field of scientific research – space medicine. In 1949, Dr. Armstrong set in motion a juggernaut of scientific and medical
achievement when he persuaded former German Luftwaffe scientists, engineers, and technicians, many of them experts in astrophysics and other
scientific disciplines, to form the nucleus of the world’s first Department of
Space Medicine at the USAFSAM at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB) in San
Antonio, Texas. Recruited under the U.S. government’s post-World War II
program “Operation Paper Clip”, the former German Air Force scientists were
instrumental in advancing the concept of manned space travel years before
NASA was created as the world’s first civilian space agency. Two of them, brothers Heinz and Fritz Haber, conceived and designed the world’s first
space cabin simulator. Built in 1952, the low-pressure chamber was used for pioneering
experiments to find the most survivable atmosphere for future space travelers confined in a space
cabin, forerunner of a spaceship capsule. Harry Armstrong
In 1955, the Haber brothers sought rudimentary knowledge of one of the then unknowns of space
travel—microgravity or weightlessness. The Habers conducted preliminary analysis of the
physiological effects experienced by pilots exposed to short periods of weightlessness. They
gleaned important data about microgravity’s impact on humans through “weightlessness flights.”
The Habers had conceived the idea of using Air Force fighters to produce momentary periods of
weightlessness during parabolic trajectory flight maneuvers executed by F-100 Super Sabre jets
flown from Randolph AFB. One of USAFSAM’s earliest achievements in space medicine development occurred shortly after
the Soviet Union shocked the world with a milestone space event – having launched into Earth
orbit Sputnik I on October 4, 1957. The event ushered in the space age and led to ‘the space race’
with the United States. Sensing the potential national security threat posed by the Soviets with
Sputnik, a dramatic American response was required. However, with the U.S. ICBM missile
program in its infancy, and untested rocket launches not a viable consideration to successfully
demonstrate vis-à-vis a ‘space event’ to counter what the Soviets had done, the USAFSAM was
tasked to showcase a space travel experiment based on earlier research. USAFSAM scientists came up with a bold idea – use the space cabin
simulator to simulate sending an Airman volunteer to the moon. To make
the journey, a human would be confined for the first time in history within
a research chamber using 100 percent recyclable air. A1C Donald Farrell, a
22-year-old overly confident and fearless Lackland AFB accounting
specialist from the Bronx, N.Y., volunteered to become America’s first
‘space traveler.’ Sequestered inside the two-and-a- half ton, 2x3 foot steel
low pressure chamber at Randolph AFB, Farrell made the seven-day
simulated lunar voyage in a device dubbed “Terrella I” (Latin for “Little
Earth”) in February 1958. Waiting to greet Farrell upon his arrival back to
Earth was future President Lyndon Johnson. Donald Farrell
The Farrell space expedition made international news and sparked America’s fascination with
space. It even inspired TV producer Rod Serling to produce a “Twilight Zone” episode based
upon the Air Force experiment. More important to the Air Force space force that Dr. Armstrong
had inaugurated, USAFSAM became an important partner with NASA, the latter having been
created only five months after Farrell’s lunar adventure. For the next 30 years NASA contracted

with the Air Force to support its manned space flight program, culminating with the six moon
landings (1969-1972). USAFSAM’s Department of Space Medicine became a hub of support to
NASA’s Project Mercury, an Air Force program that had been appropriated by the space agency
shortly after the latter’s inception. Project Mercury’s success, and NASA’s subsequent Gemini
and Apollo programs, would not have been fully achieved without USAFSAM research
experiments conducted at Randolph AFB and later at Brooks AFB in San Antonio. NASA relied
on Air Force scientists to test and study the physiological effects of space travel on primates
before American astronauts could be launched into orbit. Three unknowns of space travel had to
be addressed: acceleration, microgravity, and radiation. All three were analyzed through
suborbital flights of America’s first space monkeys. Among the first primates trained at Randolph AFB were two rhesus monkeys named after the
School of Aviation Medicine – “Sam Space” and “Miss Sam Space.” USAFSAM enlisted Airmen
technicians helped train the monkeys, while “Operation Paper Clip” recruit Dr. Hans-Georg
Clamman and his team designed and built space flight equipment needed to safely launch primates
into suborbital flight. They created a cage-like device called a biopack that served a dual purpose: it monitored the primate’s physiological functions while confining it inside the nose cone of a
ballistic missile. In 1959, less than a year after Farrell’s simulated moon trip, USAFSAM’s first
trained and equipped space monkey had traveled in space aboard a ‘Little Joe’ rocket. The Air Force space force that began at Randolph AFB eventually moved to Brooks AFB in 1959. The foundational Air Force space medicine work that progressed at Brooks AFB led to White
House recognition. During his visit to Brooks AFB on November 21, 1963, President John F. Kennedy delivered his famous “cap over the wall” speech on space exploration. He credited the
contributions of Air Force space medicine research that played an integral role in the development
of NASA’s manned space flight program. USAFSAM’s legacy as the Air Force’s inaugural space force was
recognized by the new U.S. Space Force. In November 2020, U.S. Space
Force’s first Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force (CMSSF), CMSSF
Roger Towberman, visited the Randolph AFB building 661 where the
world’s first Department of Space Medicine had been headquartered. He
was curious to see for himself where an Airman spent seven days in
simulated space on a trip to the moon, and where two monkeys cavorted
while dressed for success in specially designed space suits made from a
USAFSAM scientist’s ironing board cover. Roger Towberman
