### Professional Military Image
According to AFI 1-1, first impressions are often drawn based upon appearance. For military
members, presenting a professional image matters just as much as professional behavior. Pride in
one’s personal appearance and uniform wear greatly enhances the esprit-de-corps essential to an
effective military force. Projecting a professional military image reflects not only on the individual, but also on the USAF, both on- and off duty. While this list is not all inclusive, keep the following
expectations in mind for portraying a professional image. When in uniform, do not smoke or use smokeless tobacco products, except when authorized in
designated smoking areas. Use of personal electronic media devices, including cellular phones, earpieces, speaker phones, or text messaging while walking in uniform is authorized. Military customs and courtesies take
precedence. Do not consume food while walking in uniform. Beverage consumption is authorized. Commanders may authorize food consumption while walking in uniform during special
functions. Military customs and courtesies take precedence. Do not engage in public displays of affection, except when briefly permitted in situations where
physical contact is a commonly accepted etiquette, such as weddings, graduations, promotions, retirement ceremonies, or upon departure for or return from deployment. 23.2. Dress and Personal Appearance Standards
Dress and personal appearance standards are established to ensure every Airman reflects pride in
personal appearance, professionalism, and esprit de corps. Deeply rooted in our USAF heritage, our dress and appearance standards provide visible examples of self-discipline, commitment, and
a willingness to set aside individuality for the betterment of the whole. As outlined in DAFI 362903, Dress and Personal Appearance of United States Air Force and United States Space Force
Personnel, standards of dress and personal appearance consist of five elements: neatness, cleanliness, safety, uniformity, and military image. It is every Airman’s responsibility, regardless
of position or rank, to comply with and respectfully enforce the prescribed standards. Note: More
restrictive standards regarding personal appearance maybe imposed on- or off-duty for those
performing highly visible special mission requirements, or for those in special duty positions. 23.3. Hair Standards
Hair. Will be conservative, clean, well-groomed, present a professional appearance. Regardless
of hairstyle, hair must not exceed length and bulk standard, and ensure proper wear of headgear, helmet, or chemical mask to conform to safety requirements. Will not contain excessive amounts
of grooming aids (e.g., gel, mousse, pomade, or moisturizer), appear lopsided, touch either
eyebrow (Exception: female bangs), or end below an imaginary line across the forehead at the top
of the eyebrows that is parallel to the ground. If applied, dyes, tints, bleaches, and frostings must
result in natural hair colors, present a natural appearance and be complementary to facial hair e.g., eyebrows, lashes, beards (if authorized for medical or religious reasons), etc. Examples of natural
hair colors are brown, blonde, brunette, natural red, gray, or black. All Airmen are authorized to

wear natural color hair regardless of their natural born hair color, but when highlighted or frosted, the colors must blend as to naturally. Example: Hair colors may be displayed as a “salt-and-pepper”
look as this presents a naturally blended hair color and is, therefore, authorized. Wigs/Hairpieces/Extensions. Are authorized and will meet the same standards required for
natural hair, be of good quality, fit properly, and comply with safety, functionality, and
professional military standards. If synthetic hair or extensions are added to hair, they will be natural
hair colors, and must blend with Airmen’s hair, as to not create an unnatural appearance (Note: Extensions are prohibited for males). Wigs/Hairpieces/Extensions will not be used to cover
unauthorized hair styles. Synthetic hair or other materials are not authorized when prohibited by
safety and mission requirements. Commanders may authorize Airmen to wear plain (single color, without additional ornamentation, frills/ruffles, excess fabric that extends down the back) caps
(black, navy, or tan) while indoors due to a medical condition (e.g., Alopecia, radiation and/or
chemotherapy). Airmen are still required to wear appropriate headgear while outdoors. Note: Head
scarves are not authorized. Hairnets. Worn as required for health or safety reasons. Made of natural or a synthetic material; must be conservative (plain and moderate, being within reasonable limits; not excessive or
extreme), solid color similar to the member's hair color, also strong enough to support and control
hair and contain no metal fasteners. Hairnets are only authorized when performing related duties
as determined by applicable commander. Unauthorized Hair Colors. Hair will not be burgundy, purple, orange, fluorescent, or neon (not
all inclusive). Ombre (a gradual lightening or darkening along the lengths of the hair) or black hair
with blonde highlights and blonde hair with black are unnatural in appearance and not authorized
for wear. Other unauthorized examples include instances where hair and facial hair drastically
contrast. Unauthorized Styles. Mohawk, mullet, or etched design. Other societal trends that reasonably
appear unnatural or that display vastly different shades of natural colors, regardless of the
universally applied name. Males only: dreadlocks, coils, braids, twists, designs, and/or hair
extensions are not authorized; see Figure 23.1 for examples. Females only: Partially shaved sides
and/or back of the head with long hair on the top (requiring the wear of a ponytail, bun, or braid)

Authority and is limited to undermanned critical career fields/specialties unable to fill shortages with
applicants unless an ETP is granted to the applicant. Exceptionally qualified applicants include those
with critical skill sets, degrees, certifications, or experience directly related to the specialty for which
they are being considered. Approved hand tattoo ETPs will be documented on the DAF Form 4428, Tattoo/Brand/Body
Marking Screening/Verification. Commanders will use these provisions in determining the acceptability of tattoos, brands, and body
markings displayed by members in uniform. Per DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 2.14.4, commanders will retain the authority to be more restrictive for
covering tattoos, body ornaments and personal grooming based on legal, safety, sanitary, and/or host
nation agreements. 23.4. Body Piercing/Ornamentation

their bodies in order to achieve a visible, physical effect that disfigures, deforms, or otherwise
detracts from a professional military image may be subject to disciplinary action or involuntary
separation, as determined appropriate by the member’s commander. Failure by RegAF members, <!-- Page 452 -->

The functional community must submit their preliminary design to the Institute of Heraldry. The Institute of Heraldry will review the proposed design to ensure 1) there is no encroachment
on existing designs, 2) conformity with textile or metal manufacturing standards, and 3) develop
a cost estimate. The Institute of Heraldry will not provide final design or manufacturing
drawings until the insignia concept is approved. After the Institute of Heraldry provides their preliminary review/comments on the proposed
design, the responsible functional community prepares a staff summary sheet and coordinates
the package with other functional communities who will be authorized to wear the new badge, or patch. Staff package is then coordinated through AF/A1P, AF/A1, CMSAF and the Assistant Secretary
of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), and finally approved by the
CSAF. Upon approval, the staff package will be returned to the functional organization requesting the
new badge or patch and a copy will be sent to the Institute of Heraldry who will begin the
development process. Funding. The development cost of the new badge, patch or tab will be funded by the organization
requesting the applicable item. AF/A1 will fund SecAF and CSAF directed badge, patch or tab development and changes. Functional communities proposing a new occupational badge, duty badge, or graduate patch, or
changes to their existing badge or patch will fund all costs associated with proposed design and
development. Organizations will submit a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase
Request, to the Institute of Heraldry for the amount required for initial development. Duty Identifier Patches/Tabs. MAJCOMS and/or Functional communities may request the creation of a new duty identifier
patch/tab on an annual basis. New patch/tab requests should follow guidance as outlined in
DAFI 36-2903, paragraphs 12.7.3.1 through 12.7.3.4. Note: Identifier tabs differ from patches; a tab’s design includes a small arch e.g., “AIR ADVISOR”, “RAVEN” signifying a special, unique qualification and/or training. Request is coordinated through AF/A1P, CMSAF and to AF/A1 for final decision. Existing duty identifier patches/tabs will be re-validated on an annual basis by AFCFMs, in
coordination with A1PA. Wear guidance is outlined in DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 5.1.6.2.3. Functional communities proposing new badge, patch or tab development, or changes to their
existing badge, patch or tab will fund all costs associated with proposed design and
development. Organizations submit a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase

When affixing separate devices to a ribbon, center device and space equally. Single-constructed devices (two or more devices manufactured together). If using singleconstructed device on one ribbon, use same size device on all ribbons. Separate devices if the
combination of devices authorized is not available as a single- constructed device. In this event, place the device close to one another so they give the appearance of a single-constructed device
as long as the devices are the same, i.e., bronze cluster and silver cluster. Wear Only Separate Devices on Medals. Wear maximum of four unless wearing more
