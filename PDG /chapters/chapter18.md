The purpose of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage. The
lethal consequences of enemy attack make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern. Security applies to all members of the USAF at all times, such is the multiplicity of security with
regard to the USAF mission and the protection of all resources. Integrated defense does not stand
alone to protect personnel and resources; planners create an effective security program by
coordinating with other Department of Defense and Department of the USAF programs. Furthermore, the protection and defense of air bases requires the coordinated effort of emergency
management, antiterrorism, and other mission support function forces under the mission assurance
umbrella. This coordinated planning provides a seamless progression of mission assurance
programs and completes the installation’s defense in-depth picture. 18.2. Integrated Defense Program

multidisciplinary active and passive, offensive, and defensive capabilities, employed to mitigate potential risks
and defeat adversary threats to USAF
operations. The goal of integrated
defense is to neutralize security
threats within the base boundary and
the base security zone to ensure
unhindered USAF operations. Threat
actors include, but are not limited to
terrorists, insiders, criminals, foreign
intelligence, and security services. Potential hazards to an installation
include, but are not limited to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear-high yield explosive
attacks; natural and man-made disasters; major accidents; and accidental or deliberate release of
hazardous materials, toxic industrial materials, or chemicals. Integrated defense is an “All
Airmen” program. The teaming of integrated defense forces creates a united, seamless defense, stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals or individual units. This effort ensures all Airmen
are trained to defend themselves and integrate into defense operations while in garrison or
deployed. For additional information on integrated defense, refer to AFPD 31-1, Integrated
Defense. Figure 18.1. Base Boundary Configuration
Base Perimeter. The physical boundary of the installation. Base Boundary. JP 3-10, Joint Security Operations in Theater, defines the base boundary as a
line that delineates the surface area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and
deconfliction of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. The base boundary should
<!-- Page 343 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
343
be established with consideration for mission, enemy, terrain and weather, time, troops available, and civil considerations (METT-TC), specifically balancing the need of the integrated defense
forces to control key terrain with the ability to accomplish the mission. Boundaries may not
necessarily coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines, or legal boundaries. Base Security Zone. The base security zone is a USAF unique concept and term to be used intraservice only. The USAF uses the planning term base security zone to describe the area of concern
around an air base and to support the establishment and adjustment of the base boundary. The base
security zone is the area outside the base perimeter from which the base may be vulnerable from
standoff weapons (mortars, rockets, and man portable air defense systems) and waterborne threats. The installation commander should identify and arrange to have the base security zone recognized
as the base boundary. If the base boundary does not include all of the terrain of the base security
zone, the installation commander is responsible for either mitigating (through coordination with
local, state, federal agencies, or the host nation or area commander) or accepting the risks of enemy
attack from the terrain outside the base boundary. Figure 18.1. is provided to show an example of
a base perimeter, base boundary, and base security zone configuration. 18.3. Integrated Defense Effects
Commanders execute integrated defense with the objective of achieving nine desired effects based
on the risk management process. Those effects are briefly described here. Anticipate. Anticipate threat intentions and actions (intelligence preparation of the operational
environment or crime trend analysis). Deter. Deter threat activity through active community policing, boundary and internal circulation
control, controlled area marking, and prudent physical security measures. Detect. Detect threats through the use of lighting, intrusion detection systems/early warning
systems, and closed-circuit television, etc. Assess. Assess to identify friend or foe using cameras, posted sentries, response forces, and
intrusion detection systems, etc. Warn. Warn friendly forces of adversary activity through systems, such as mass notification, radio, public address, commander’s access channels, voice, hand and arm signals, and cellular
telephones, and instant messenger/short message system texting. Defeat. Defeat threats through appropriate, progressive force application, coordinated security
force response, and integration of forces. Delay. Delay adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology, physical
security measures, and forces. Another way to say this is to apply defense-in-depth procedures. Defend. Defend assets through threat- and effects-based planning that integrates all friendly forces
into a single, comprehensive plan by ensuring friendly forces are trained and qualified on arming
and use of force. Also, ensure the fighting positions are established where prudent, based on risk
analyses. Recover. Recover from adversarial events by applying effective command and control, and
developing and exercising Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2. Application of Integrated Defense Desired Effects. Integrated defense desired effects are not
randomly applied to an installation; they are deliberately achieved through innovative and reliable
tactics, techniques, and procedures based on integrated defense risk management process and
analysis. As an example, systematic application of integrated defense to achieve desired effects
<!-- Page 344 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
344
could involve a situation when it would be preferred to deter a threat; but if that does not succeed, the next ideal effect would be to detect the threat. Once the threat is detected, assessment by forces
occurs. Friendly forces are then warned of the threat and attempts are made to defeat or eliminate
the threat. If the threat cannot be defeated, it must be delayed. If delay is not possible, defensive
measures must be taken to mitigate the effects of the threat. Recovery actions are then implemented
to consolidate and reorganize friendly forces and restore operations. 18.4. Base Defense Operations Center
The base defense operations center is the command and control center for integrated defense
operations during routine and emergency operations. The defense force commander will establish
a base defense operations center to coordinate and direct, via the operational chain of command, the tactical control of integrated defense forces and supporting capabilities. Central security
control, the law enforcement desk, and other security forces control centers will operate under
control of the base defense operations center at all locations, to include operations at home station
and deployed. 18.5. Integrated Defense Risk Management Process
The integrated defense risk management process provides installation commanders, integrated
defense working groups, defense force commanders, and defense planners, the ability to produce
effects-based, integrated defense plans by using a standardized model to identify risks and develop
risk management strategies. These strategies leverage finite resources against adaptive threats to
protect USAF resources and personnel. The integrated defense risk management process identifies
at-risk assets and aids the integrated defense working groups in generating the criticality
assessment and the risk assessment products. A risk reduction decision based on a clear
understanding of what is important, the estimated threat, and how the asset might be damaged or
destroyed, is then developed through a logical process involving asset criticality, threat, and
vulnerability assessments. 18.6. Security Protection Levels
Protection Level 1. Protection level 1 (PL1) is assigned to those resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, damage, misuse, or compromise would result in unacceptable mission
degradation to the strategic capability of the United States or catastrophic consequences for the
nation. PL1 security must result in the greatest possible deterrence against hostile acts. This level
of security will provide maximum means to detect and defeat a hostile force before it is able to
seize, damage, or destroy resources. PL 1 examples include nuclear weapons in storage mated to
a delivery system or in transit; designated command, control, and communications facilities; and
aircraft designated to transport the U.S. President. Protection Level 2. Protection level 2 (PL2) is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, damage, misuse, or compromise would result in significant mission degradation to the
war fighting capability of the United States. PL2 security must result in significant deterrence
against hostile acts. This level of security will ensure a significant probability of detecting and
defeating a hostile force before it is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources. PL 2 examples
include nonnuclear alert forces; designated space and launch systems; expensive, few in number, or one-of-a-kind systems or facilities; and intelligence-gathering systems. Protection Level 3. Protection level 3 (PL3) is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, damage, misuse, or compromise would result in mission degradation to the United
States warfighting capability. PL3 security must result in a reasonable degree of deterrence against
hostile acts. This level of security ensures the capability to impede a hostile force and limit damage
<!-- Page 345 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
345
to resources. PL 3 examples include non-alert resources that can be generated to alert status; selected command, control, and communications facilities, systems, and equipment; and nonlaunch-critical or non-unique space launch systems. Protection Level 4. Protection level 4 (PL4) is assigned to operational or mission support
resources that directly or indirectly support power projection assets and the war fighting mission
for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would adversely affect mission
capability. PL4 resources are secured by containing them in controlled areas with owners or users
being responsible for security. Security forces provide response to threats. This level of security
must reduce the opportunity for theft of or damage to resources. PL 4 examples include facilities
storing Category I, II, or III sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives; fuels and
liquid oxygen storage areas; and USAF accounting and finance vault areas. <!-- Page 346 -->

### USAF Operations Security Program
The purpose of operations security is to reduce the vulnerability of USAF missions by eliminating
or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. Operations
security uses a cycle to identify, analyze, and control critical information that applies to all
activities used to prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations. USAF
personnel can be under observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while moving, or when deployed and conducting combat operations. USAF units utilize a profiling
process to identify vulnerabilities and indicators of their day-to-day activities. With this
understanding, operations security program managers and signature managers use the signature
management methodology to apply measures or countermeasures to hide, control, or simulate
indicators. Operations security signature managers also recommend modifying the day-to-day
activities at an installation or organization to create variations in the status quo. Operations
security involves attentiveness to: Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and interpreted to derive
critical information in time to be useful to adversaries. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities
of friendly actions to adversary exploitation. Operational Effectiveness. Operations security involves a series of analyses to examine the
planning, preparation, execution, and post-execution phases of any operation or activity across the
entire spectrum of military action and in any operational environment. Operations security analysis
provides decision-makers with a means of weighing the risk to their operations. Decision-makers
must determine the amount of risk they are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances
in the same way as operational risk management allows commanders to assess risk in mission
planning. Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers
apply operations security from the earliest stages of planning. Operations Security Principles. Operations security principles must be integrated into
operational, support, exercise, acquisition planning, and day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless
transition to contingency operations. The operations security cycle consists of the following
distinct actions: Identify critical information. Analyze threats. Analyze vulnerabilities. Assess risk. Apply appropriate operations security countermeasures. 18.8. Operations Security Indicators
Operations security indicators are friendly, detectable actions and open-source information that
can be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information. The five basic
<!-- Page 347 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
347
characteristics of operations security indicators that make them potentially valuable to an
adversary are briefly described here. Signatures. Signatures are observable activities and operational trends that reveal critical
information to adversary intelligence collection. Signature management is a systematic approach
to identify, prioritize, and manage physical, technical, and administrative indicators of friendly
forces’ operational profiles that, if ignored, will be exploited by an adversary to achieve an
operational advantage over friendly force objectives. Defense of operational profiles is
accomplished by implementing measures to deny adversary collection of critical information. Associations. An association is the relationship of an indicator to other information or activities. The characteristics of the relationship make it identifiable or causes it to stand out. Profiles. Each functional activity generates its own set of more-or-less unique signatures and
associations. The sum of these signatures and associations is the activity’s profile. A profiling
process is used to map the local operating environment and capture process points that present key
signatures and profiles with critical information value. Contrasts. A contrast is any difference observed between an activity’s standard profile and most
recent or current actions. Exposure. Exposure refers to when and for how long an indicator is observed. The longer an
indicator is observed, the better chance an adversary can form associations and update the profile
of operational activities. <!-- Page 348 -->

### Information Protection Procedures
Information protection is a subset of the USAF security enterprise and consists of the core security
disciplines (personnel, industrial, and information security) used to determine military, civilian, and contractor personnel eligibility to access classified information, ensure the protection of
classified information released or disclosed to industry in connection with classified contracts, and
protect classified information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that, if subject to
unauthorized disclosure, could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security. 18.10. Information Security
All personnel in the USAF are responsible for protecting classified information and CUI under
their custody and control. DoDM5200.01V1_DAFMAN16-1404V1, Information Security
Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, provide the guidance for managing
classified information and CUI. Classified Information. Classified information is designated accordingly to protect national
security. There are three levels of classification: Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential. Each
individual is responsible for providing the proper safeguards for classified information, reporting
security incidents, and understanding the sanctions for noncompliance. Top Secret. Top Secret shall be applied to information that the unauthorized disclosure of which
reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the
original classification authority is able to identify or describe. Secret. Secret shall be applied to information that the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably
could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification
authority is able to identify or describe. Confidential. Confidential shall be applied to information that the unauthorized disclosure of
which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original
classification authority is able to identify or describe. 18.11. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). CUI is information the government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for
or on behalf of the government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or
permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls. Requirements, controls, and protective measures developed for these materials are found in DoDI 5200.48_AFI 16-1403, Controlled Unclassified Information. Original Classification. Original classification is the initial decision by an original classification
authority that an item of information could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or
describable damage to the national security subjected to unauthorized disclosure and requires
protection in the interest of national security. Only officials designated in writing may make
original classification decisions. Derivative Classification. USAF policy is to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, and
protect classified information and records, and to destroy classified records containing classified
information, consistent with national policy. CUI will also be protected per national policy. Within

AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
349
the Department of Defense all cleared personnel are authorized to derivatively classify
information, if: 1) they have received initial training before making derivative classification
decisions, and 2) they have receiver refresher training every year. Derivative classification is the
incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating classified information in a new form or
document. Derivative classifiers must use authorized types of sources for making decisions. One
of the most important responsibilities of the derivative classifier is to observe and respect the
classification determinations made by an original classification authority. Marking Classified Information. All classified information shall be clearly identified by
marking, designation, or electronic labelling in accordance with DoDM5200.01V2_AFMAN161404V2, Information Security Program: Marking of Classified Information. Marking classified
information serves to: alert holders to the presence of classified information; identify the
information needing protection; indicate the level of classification assigned to the information; provide guidance on downgrading (if any) and declassification; give information on the sources
of and reasons for classification; notify holders of special access, control, or safeguarding
requirements; and promote information sharing, facilitate judicious use of resources, and simplify
management through implementation of uniform and standardized processes. Specific Markings on Documents. Every classified document must be marked to show the
highest classification of information contained within the document. The marking must be
conspicuous enough to alert anyone handling the document that the document is classified. Every
document will contain the overall classification of the document, banner lines, portion markings
indicating the classification level of specific classified information within the document, the
classification authority block, date of origin, and downgrading instructions, if any, and
declassification instructions. The three most common markings on a classified document are the
banner

DoDM5200.01V2_DAFMAN16-1404V2, for additional information and marking illustrations. the classification authority block. Refer
lines, portion markings, and
Safeguarding Classified Information. Everyone who works with classified information is
personally responsible for taking proper precautions to ensure unauthorized persons do not gain
access to classified information. Before granting access to classified information, the person must
have: (1) security clearance eligibility, (2) a signed Standard Form (SF) 312, Classified
Information Non-Disclosure Agreement, and (3) a need-to-know. The individual with authorized
possession, knowledge, or control of the information must determine whether the person receiving
the information has been granted the appropriate security clearance access by proper authority. An
authorized person shall keep classified material removed from storage under constant surveillance. The authorized person must place coversheets on classified documents not in secure storage to
prevent unauthorized persons from viewing the information. The following forms will be used to
cover classified information outside of storage: SF 703, Top Secret (Cover Sheet), SF 704, Secret
(Cover Sheet), and SF 705, Confidential (Cover Sheet). End-of-Day Security Checks. Use SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, to record the end of the
day security checks. This form is required for any area where classified information is used or
stored. Ensure all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material are
checked. Classified information systems should specifically be stored in a general services
administration approved safe or in buildings or areas cleared for open storage of classified. 18.12. Security Incidents Involving Classified Information
Anyone finding classified material out of proper control must take custody of and safeguard the
material and immediately notify their commander, supervisor, or security manager. The terms
associated with security incidents are formally defined in DoDM5200.01V3_DAFMAN16-

1404V3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information. The general
security incident characteristics are briefly described here. Infraction. An infraction is a security incident involving failure to comply with requirements (i.e., the provisions of References (d) and (f), this Manual or other applicable security policy) which
cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in the loss, of classified records, or in the
suspected or actual compromise of classified information. An infraction may be unintentional or
inadvertent. While it does not constitute a security violation, if left uncorrected, can lead to security
violations or compromises. It requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate corrective action but does
not require an in-depth investigation. Violation. Violations are security incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and negligent for
security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in the loss of classified records or
the compromise of classified information. Security violations require an inquiry and/or
investigation
Compromise. A compromise is a security incident (more specifically, a violation) in which there
is an unauthorized disclosure of classified information (i.e., disclosure to a person(s) who does not
have a valid clearance, authorized access, or a need to know). Loss. A loss occurs when records containing classified information cannot be physically located
or accounted for. This could include classified records/equipment is discovered missing during an
audit and which cannot be immediately located. Data Spills. Classified data spills occur when classified data is introduced either onto an
unclassified information system or to an information system with a lower level of classification, or to a system not accredited to process data of that restrictive category. Although it is possible
that no unauthorized disclosure occurred, classified data spills are considered and handled as a
possible compromise of classified information involving information systems, networks, and
computer equipment until the inquiry determines whether an unauthorized disclosure did or did
not occur. Information in the Public Media. If classified information appears in the public media, including
on public Internet sites, or if approached by a representative of the media, DoD personnel shall be
careful not to make any statement or comment that confirms the accuracy of or verifies the
information requiring protection. Report the matter as instructed by the appropriate DoD
Component guidance, but do not discuss it with anyone who does not, in the case of classified
information, have an appropriate security clearance and need to know. 18.13. Industrial Security
USAF policy is to identify, in classified contracts, specific information and sensitive resources that
must be protected against compromise or loss while entrusted to industry. Security policies, requirements, and procedures are applicable to USAF personnel and on-base Department of
Defense contractors performing services under the terms of a properly executed contract and
associated security agreement or similar document, as determined by the installation commander. 18.14. Personnel Security
The Personnel Security Program entails policies and procedures that ensure military, civilian, and
contractor personnel who access classified information or occupy a sensitive position are
consistent with interests of national security. For most personnel, this involves procedures for
obtaining proper security clearances required for performing official duties. It involves the
investigation process, adjudication (approval) for eligibility, and the continuous evaluation for
<!-- Page 351 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
351
maintaining eligibility. Commanders and supervisors must continually observe and evaluate their
subordinates with respect to these criteria and immediately report any unfavorable conduct or
conditions that might bear on the subordinates’ trustworthiness and eligibility to occupy a sensitive
position or have eligibility to classified information. Adjudicative Guidelines. The Department of Defense Central Adjudication Facility is the
designated authority to grant, deny, and revoke security clearance eligibility using the Department
of Defense 13 adjudicative guidelines, while applying the whole person concept and mitigating
factors. Individuals are granted due process and may appeal if the security clearance eligibility is
denied or revoked. For additional details, refer to the DoDM 5200.02_AFMAN 16-1405, Air Force
Personnel Security Program. The 13 Adjudicative Guidelines include: Allegiance to the United States
Alcohol Consumption
Foreign Influence
Foreign Preference
Sexual Behavior
Personal Conduct
Financial Considerations
Drug Involvement
Psychological Conditions
Criminal Conduct
Handling Protected Information
Allegiance to the United States – An individual must be of unquestioned allegiance to the
United States. The willingness to safeguard classified information is in doubt if there is any
reason to suspect an individual's allegiance to the United States. Foreign Influence – Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a
foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is
vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign Preference – When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a
foreign country over the United States, then be or she may be prone to provide information or
make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. Sexual Behavior – Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or
emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual
to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual's
reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference
concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual
orientation of the individual. Personal Conduct – Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's
reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Financial Considerations – Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to
abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive
<!-- Page 352 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
352
gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that
cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. Alcohol Consumption – Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of
questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an
individual's reliability and trustworthiness. Drug Involvement – Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and
because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Psychological Conditions – Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for
there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating
information under this guideline. No negative inference concerning the standards in this
Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling. Criminal Conduct – Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to
comply with laws, rules and regulations
Handling Protected Information – Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and
regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an
individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such
information, and is a serious security concern
Outside Activities – Involvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of
security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual's security responsibilities
and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Use of Information Technology – Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or
regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an
individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to
properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information Technology
Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the
communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of information. <!-- Page 353 -->

### The Privacy Act
The Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended) establishes a code of fair information practices that govern
the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information about individuals that
is maintained in a system of records by federal agencies. The Privacy Act provides individuals
with a means by which to seek access to and amend their records and sets forth agency recordkeeping requirements. Disclosure of Information. Privacy Act rights are personal to the individual who is the subject of
the record and cannot be asserted derivatively by others. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure
of information from a system of records without the written consent of the subject individual. Individuals have the right to request access or amendment to their records in a system. The parent
of any minor, or the legal guardian of an incompetent, may act on behalf of that individual. Collection of Information. The Privacy Act limits the collection of information to what the law
or executive orders authorize. System of Records Notices (SORNs) must be published in the
federal register allowing the public a 30-day comment period. Such collection must not conflict
with the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A Privacy Act
statement must be given when individuals are asked to provide personal information about
themselves for collection in a system of records. System of Records Maintenance. Privacy Act system of records is a group of any records under
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the individual’s name, number, or unique identifier. Note: Department of Defense personnel may disclose records to other offices
in the Department of Defense when there is “an official need to know” and to other federal
government agencies or individuals when a discloser of record is a “routine use” published in the
SORNs or as authorized by a Privacy Act exception. In addition, information may be released for
a disclosed specified purpose with the subject’s consent. The office of primary responsibility of
the data should keep an account of all information they’ve released. Personally Identifiable Information. Personally identifiable information in a system of records
must be safeguarded to ensure “an official need to know” access of the records and to avoid actions
that could result in harm, embarrassment, or unfairness to the individual. The Office of
Management and Budget defines a personally identifiable information breach as, “A loss of
control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or
any similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an other
than authorized purpose have access or potential access to personally identifiable information, whether physical or electronic.” For further information, definitions, exemptions, exceptions, or
responsibilities and procedures for safeguarding and reporting of personally identifiable
information breaches, refer to AFI 33-332. 18.16. Freedom of Information Act
The Freedom of Information Act provides access to federal agency records (or parts of these
records) except those protected from release by specific exemptions. Freedom of Information Act
requests are written requests that cite or imply the Freedom of Information Act. The law establishes
rigid time limits for replying to requesters and permits assessing fees in certain instances. The
Freedom of Information Act imposes mandatory time limits of 20 workdays to either deny the
<!-- Page 354 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
354
request or release the requested records. The law permits an additional 10-workday extension in
the event that specific unusual circumstances exist. Note: Denials require notification of appeal
rights. Requesters can file an appeal or litigate. Refer to DoDM 5400.07-R_AFMAN 33-302 for
specific policy and procedures on the Freedom of Information Act and for guidance on disclosing
records to the public. 18.17. Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is defined as the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of
computers, electronic communications systems, wire communication, and electronic
communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Cybersecurity disciplines include Air Force
Risk Management Framework, IT controls/countermeasures, communications security, TEMPEST (formerly known as emissions security), AF Assessment and Authorization (formerly
known as Certification and Accreditation Program), and Cybersecurity Workforce Improvement
Program. AFI 17-130, Cybersecurity Program Management, describes risk management and
cybersecurity as representations of dynamic, multi-disciplinary sets of challenges. Processes and
practices must continuously evolve and improve to match the ever- changing threat environment. Cybersecurity Program Risk Management Strategy. The USAF’s Cybersecurity Program’s
risk management strategy must ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all
information owned or held in trust by the USAF is protected. The program strategy must also be
integrated into all key mission and business processes. To ensure operational agility, cybersecurity
capabilities will be balanced to include safety, reliability, interoperability, and ease of use, while
maximizing performance, as well as promoting transparency and interoperability with USAF
mission partners. All USAF personnel are required to complete Information Assurance Awareness
training prior to system access and annually thereafter. Five Functions of the USAF Cybersecurity Program. The USAF Cybersecurity Program
encompasses the five functions briefly described here. Identify. Develop and maintain the organizational understanding required to manage
cybersecurity risk. Protect. Implement controls to ensure the delivery of mission critical infrastructure services. Detect. Possess the ability to detect cybersecurity events when they occur. Respond. Possess the ability to take action regarding detected cybersecurity events. Recover. Possess the ability to remain operationally resilient and to restore capabilities or
services that were impaired due to cybersecurity events. 18.18. Computer Security
Computer security consists of measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of information systems assets including hardware, software, firmware, and
information being processed, stored, and communicated. Limited Authorized Personal Use. Government-provided hardware and software are for official
use and limited authorized personal use only. Limited personal use must be of reasonable duration
and frequency that has been approved by the supervisor or office policy and does not adversely affect
performance of official duties, overburden systems, or reflect adversely on the USAF or the
Department of Defense. Internet-based capabilities include collaborative tools, such as simple
notification service, social media, user-generated content, e-mail, instant messaging, and online

discussion forums. When accessing internet-based capabilities using federal government
resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals shall comply with
operations security guidance in AFI 10-701, and must be compliant with the requirements of the
Joint Ethics Regulation. 18.19. Information Systems
An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information
systems also include specialized systems, such as industrial/process controls, telephone switching
and private branch systems, and environmental controls. All authorized users must protect
information systems against tampering, theft, and loss. Protection occurs by controlling physical
access to facilities and data; ensuring user access to information system resources is based upon a
favorable background investigation, security clearance, and need to know (for classified); and
ensuring protection of applicable unclassified, sensitive, and classified information through
encryption, according to the applicable Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
Publication 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Countermeasures. A countermeasure is any action, device, procedure, or technique that meets or
opposes (counters) a threat, vulnerability, or attack by eliminating, preventing, or minimizing
damage, or by discovering and reporting the event so corrective action can be taken. Threats. Every USAF information system has vulnerabilities and is susceptible to exploitation. Threats to information systems include, but are not limited to, any circumstance or event with the
potential to adversely impact any operation or function through an information system via
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, or denial of service. There are three steps involved in protecting information systems from viruses and other forms of
malicious logic. These steps include a combination of human and technological countermeasures
to ensure the protection is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the information system. Infection. Infection is the invasion of information system applications, processes, or services by a
virus or malware code causing the information system to malfunction. Detection. Detection is a signature or behavior-based antivirus system that signals when an
anomaly caused by a virus or malware occurs. Reaction. When notified of a virus or malware detection, react by immediately notifying your
information system security officer and following local procedures. 18.20. Mobile Computing Devices
Mobile computing devices are information systems, such as portable electronic devices, laptops, smartphones, and other handheld devices that can store data locally and access USAF managed
networks through mobile access capabilities. All wireless systems (including associated peripheral
devices, operating systems, applications, network connection methods, and services) must be
approved prior to processing Department of Defense information. The information systems
security officer will maintain documented approval authority and inventory information on all
approved devices. All mobile computing devices not assigned or in use must be secured to prevent
tampering or theft. Users of mobile devices will sign a detailed user agreement outlining the
responsibilities and restrictions for use. 18.21. Public Computing Facilities or Services
Do not use public computing facilities or services, such as hotel business centers, to process
<!-- Page 356 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
356
government-owned unclassified, sensitive, or classified information. Public computing facilities
or services include any information technology resources not under your private or U.S. Governmental control. Use of e-mail applications, messaging software, or web applications to
access web-based government services constitutes a compromise of login credentials and must be
reported as a security incident. 18.22. Communications Security
Communications security refers to measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized persons
information derived from information systems of the U.S. Government related to national security
and to ensure the authenticity of such information systems. Communications security protection
results from applying security measures to communications and information systems generating, handling, storing, processing, or using classified or sensitive information, the loss of which could
adversely affect national security interests. Communications security also entails applying
physical security measures to communications security information or materials. Cryptosecurity. Cryptosecurity is a component of communications security resulting from the
provision and proper use of technically sound cryptosystems. Transmission Security. Transmission security is a component of communications security
resulting from the application of measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and
exploitation by means other than cryptoanalysis. Examples of transmission security measures
include using secured communications systems, registered mail, secure telephone and facsimile
equipment, manual cryptosystems, call signs, or authentication to transmit classified information. Physical Security. Physical security is communications security resulting from the use of all
physical measures necessary to safeguard communications security material from access by
unauthorized persons. Physical security measures include the application of control procedures
and physical barriers. Physical security also ensures continued integrity, prevents access by
unauthorized persons, and controls the spread of communications security techniques and
technology when not in the best interest of the United States and our allies. Common physical
security measures include verifying the need to know and clearance of personnel granted access, following proper storage, and handling procedures, accurately accounting for all materials, transporting materials using authorized means, and immediately reporting the loss or possible
compromise of materials. 18.23. TEMPEST
TEMPEST, formerly known as emissions security, is protection resulting from all measures taken
to deny unauthorized persons information of value that may be derived from the interception and
analysis of compromising emanations from cryptographic equipment, information systems, and
telecommunications systems. The objective of TEMPEST is to deny access to classified, and in
some instances unclassified, information that contains compromising emanations within an
inspectable space. The inspectable space is considered the area in which it would be difficult for
an adversary with specialized equipment to attempt to intercept compromising emanations without
being detected. TEMPEST countermeasures, such as classified and unclassified equipment
separation, shielding, and grounding, are implemented to reduce the risk of compromising
emanations. <!-- Page 357 -->

The USAF seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist acts by giving guidance on collecting and
disseminating timely threat information, providing training to all USAF members, developing
comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist incidents, allocating funds and personnel, and
implementing antiterrorism measures. HAF. At the strategic level, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance
Reconnaissance, and Cyber Effects Operations (HAF/A2/6) and the Director for Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Operations, are responsible for ensuring the timely collection
processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of foreign intelligence, current intelligence, and national-level intelligence information concerning terrorist activities, terrorist organizations, and force protection issues. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AFOSI) is the lead USAF agency for collection, investigation, analysis, and response for threats
arising from terrorists, criminal activity, foreign intelligence, and security services. AFOSI is
primarily focused on countering adversary intelligence collection activities against U.S. Armed
Forces and will act as the USAF single point of contact with federal, state, local, and foreign nation
law enforcement, counterintelligence, and security agencies. Commanders. Commanders at all levels who understand the threat can assess their ability to
prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack. A terrorism threat assessment requires the
identification of a full range of known or estimated terrorist threat capabilities (including the use
or threat of use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosives and weapons
of mass destruction). In addition to tasking appropriate agencies to collect information, commanders at all levels should encourage personnel under their command to report information
on individuals, events, or situations that could pose a threat to the security of Department of
Defense personnel, families, facilities, and resources. Antiterrorism Training. At least annually, commanders conduct comprehensive field and staff
training to exercise antiterrorism plans, to include antiterrorism physical security measures, continuity of operations, critical asset risk management, and emergency management plans. Antiterrorism training should include terrorism scenarios specific to the location and be based on
current enemy tactics, techniques, procedures, and lessons learned. Additionally, the current
baseline through force protection condition ‘Charlie’ measures shall be exercised annually at
installations and self-supported separate facilities. Random Antiterrorism Measures Program
Installation commanders shall develop and implement a random antiterrorism measures program
that will include all units on the installation. The intent of the program is to provide random, multiple security measures that consistently change the look of an installation’s antiterrorism
program. Random antiterrorism measures introduce uncertainty to an installation’s overall force protection
program to defeat surveillance attempts and to make random antiterrorism measures difficult for a
terrorist to accurately predict our actions. The program shall be included in antiterrorism plans and
<!-- Page 358 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
358
tie directly with all force protection conditions, including force protection condition ‘normal’, to
ensure continuity and standardization, should threats require USAF-wide implementation. Times
for implementation, location, and duration of random antiterrorism measures shall be regularly
changed to avoid predictability. Execution of random antiterrorism measures shall be broad based
and involve all units and personnel. 18.25. Ground Transportation Security
Criminal and terrorist acts against individuals usually occur outside the home and after the victim’s
habits have been established. Your most predictable habit is the route you travel on a regular basis. Always check for fingerprints, smudges, or tampering of the interior and exterior of your vehicle, including the tires and trunk. If you detect something out of the ordinary, do not touch anything. Immediately contact the local authorities. When overseas, travel with a companion. Select a plain
car and avoid using government vehicles, when possible. Do not openly display military equipment
or decals with military affiliations. Keep doors locked at all times. Do not let someone you do not
know direct you to a specific taxi. Ensure taxis are licensed and have safety equipment (seat belts
at a minimum). Ensure that the face of the taxi driver and the picture on the license are the same. 18.26. Commercial Air Transportation Security Overseas
Before traveling overseas, consult the Foreign Clearance Guide to ensure you meet all
requirements for travel to a particular country. Get the required ‘area of responsibility’ threat
briefing from your security officer, antiterrorism officers, or the appropriate counterintelligence or
security organization within three months prior to traveling overseas. Use office symbols on travel
documents if the word description denotes a sensitive position. Use military contracted flag
carriers. Avoid traveling through high-risk areas. Do not use rank or military address on tickets. Do not discuss military affiliation. Have proper identification to show airline and immigration
officials. Do not carry classified documents unless absolutely mission essential. Dress
conservatively. Wear clothing that covers military or United States-affiliated tattoos. Carry plain
civilian luggage. Do not wear or carry distinct military items. 18.27. Suspicious Packages or Mail
Look for an unusual or unknown place of origin; no return address; excessive amount of postage; abnormal size or shape; protruding strings; aluminum foil; wires; misspelled words; differing
return address and postmark; handwritten labels; unusual odor; unusual or unbalanced weight; springiness in the top or bottom; inflexibility; crease marks; discoloration or oily stains; incorrect
titles or title with no name; excessive security material; ticking, beeping, or other sounds; or special
instruction markings, such as “personal, rush, do not delay, or confidential” on any packages or
mail received. Be vigilant for evidence of powder or other contaminants. Never cut tape, strings, or other wrappings on a suspect package. If the package has been moved, place the package in a
plastic bag to prevent any leakage of contents. If handling mail suspected of containing chemical
or biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. Report suspicious mail
immediately and make a list of personnel who were in the room when the suspicious envelope or
package was identified. 18.28. General Antiterrorism Personal Protection
Individual vigilance is integral to the antiterrorism program, whether stateside or overseas. Several
actions are provided here to help ensure individual protection. Dress and behave in a way that does not draw attention. Be inconspicuous and avoid publicity. <!-- Page 359 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
359
Travel in small groups. Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations. Be unpredictable. Vary daily routines to/from home and work. Be alert for anything suspicious or out of place. Avoid giving unnecessary personal details to anyone unless their identity can be verified. Be alert to strangers who are on government property for no apparent reason. Refuse to meet with strangers outside your workplace. Always advise associates or family members of your destination and anticipated time of arrival. Report unsolicited contacts to authorities. Do not open doors to strangers. Memorize key telephone numbers and dialing instructions. Be cautious about giving information regarding family travel or security measures. When overseas, learn and practice a few key phrases in the local language. 18.29. Home and Family Security
Spouses and children should always practice basic precautions for personal security. Familiarize
family members with the local terrorist threat and regularly review protective measures and
techniques. Ensure family members know what to do in any type of emergency. Several actions
are provided here to help ensure home and family security. Restrict the possession of house keys. Lock all entrances at night, including the garage. Keep the house locked, even if you are home. Destroy all envelopes or other items that show your name, rank, or other personal information. Remove names and rank from mailboxes. Watch for unfamiliar vehicles cruising or parked frequently in the area, particularly if one or
more occupants remain in the vehicle for extended periods. Post or preprogram emergency telephone numbers for immediate access. Report all threatening
phone calls to security officials and the telephone company, making note of any background
noise, accent, nationality, or location. 18.30. Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence
Human intelligence is a category of intelligence derived from information collected and provided
by human sources and collectors, and where the human being is the primary collection instrument. Counterintelligence is information gathered and activities conducted to protect against such
threats. A few primary human intelligence collection efforts are briefly described here. Interrogation. Interrogation is the systematic effort to procure information to answer specific
collection requirements by direct and indirect questioning techniques of a person who is in the
custody of the forces conducting the questioning. Proper questioning of enemy combatants, enemy
prisoners of war, or other detainees by trained and certified Department of Defense interrogators
<!-- Page 360 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025

may result in information provided either willingly or unwittingly. Source Operations. Designated and fully trained military human intelligence collection personnel
may develop information through the elicitation of sources, to include: “walk-in” sources who, without solicitation, make the first contact with human intelligence personnel; developed sources
who are met over a period of time and provide information based on operational requirements; unwitting persons with access to sensitive information. Debriefing. Debriefing is the process of questioning cooperating human sources to satisfy
intelligence requirements, consistent with applicable law. The source usually is not in custody and
is usually willing to cooperate. Debriefing may be conducted at all echelons and in all operational
environments. Through debriefing, face-to-face meetings, conversations, and elicitation, information may be obtained from a variety of human sources. Document and Media Exploitation. Captured documents and media, when properly processed
and exploited, may provide valuable information, such as adversary plans and intentions, force
locations, equipment capabilities, and logistical status. The category of “captured documents and
media” includes all media capable of storing fixed information, as well as computer storage
material. This operation is not a primary human intelligence function but may be conducted by
any intelligence personnel with appropriate language support. Human Intelligence Threat Areas. A few primary threat areas are briefly described here. Espionage. The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving
information about national defense with intent or reason to believe the information may be used to
the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Subversion. An act or acts inciting military or civilian personnel of the Department of Defense to
violate laws, disobey lawful orders or regulations, or disrupt military activities with the willful
intent, thereby to interfere with or impair the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the U.S. Armed
Forces. Sabotage. An act or acts with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of a
country by willfully injuring or destroying, or attempting to injure or destroy, any national defense
or war material, premises, or utilities, as well as human and natural resources. Terrorism. The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate
fear intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are
generally political, religious, or ideological. 18.31. Incident Reporting
AFI 71-101, Volume 4, Counterintelligence, requires individuals who have reportable contacts or
acquire reportable information, to immediately (within 30 days of the contact) report the contact
or information either verbally or in writing to AFOSI. The AFOSI initiates and conducts all
counterintelligence investigations, operations, collections, and other related activities for the
USAF. When appropriate, or when overseas, AFOSI coordinates these activities with the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The AFOSI is also the installationlevel training agency for counterintelligence awareness briefings and is the sole USAF repository
for the collection and retention of reportable information. Contact is defined as any exchange of information directed to an individual, including solicited or
unsolicited telephone calls, e-mail, radio contact, and face-to-face meetings. Examples include: contact with a foreign diplomatic establishment; a request by anyone for illegal or unauthorized
access to classified or unclassified controlled information; personal contact with any individual
<!-- Page 361 -->
AFH 1, AIRMAN 15 February 2025
361
who suggests that a foreign intelligence or any terrorist organization may have targeted him or her
or others for possible intelligence exploitation; or receipt of information indicating military
members, civilian employees, or Department of Defense contractors have contemplated, attempted, or effected the deliberate compromise or unauthorized release of classified or
unclassified controlled information. USAF antiterrorism enlists the eyes and ears of all USAF military, civilians, contractors, and
dependents. Each installation outlines procedures in their installation antiterrorism plan on how
to receive and log suspicious activity reports and suspicious incident reports and pass those reports
expeditiously to their servicing AFOSI. 18.32. Protection of the President and Others
As stated in AFI 71-101, Volume 2, Protective Service Matters, because of a formal agreement
between the Department of Defense and U.S. Secret Service, individuals affiliated with the U.S. Armed Forces have a special obligation to report information regarding the safety and protection
of the U.S. President or anyone else under the protection of the U.S. Secret Service. This includes
the Vice President, the President- and Vice President-elect, and visiting heads of foreign states or
foreign governments. In most cases, former Presidents and their spouses are also afforded lifetime
protection of the U.S. Secret Service.
