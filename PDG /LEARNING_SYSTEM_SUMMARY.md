2. **Core Learning Objectives** - 5-10 measurable objectives
3. **Key Takeaways** - Essential concepts with "why it matters"
4. **Significance & Application** - Real-world relevance
5. **Retention Strategies** - Memory techniques and study methods
6. **Common Pitfalls** - Typical mistakes and confusions
7. **Chapter Structure Map** - Hierarchical outline
8. **Quiz Focus Areas** - Most important concepts for testing

**Metadata:**
- Study time estimate
- Difficulty level
- Prerequisites

### 3. Quiz Banks (24 folders)

- Every question includes rationale and reference
- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

## 📖 How to Use the System

### For Individual Study:

1. **Start with Master Overview**
   - Read `system_overview/AFH1_Master_Overview.md`
   - Understand overall system structure and themes
   - Choose optimal study path for your needs

2. **For Each Chapter:**
   - Read chapter overview first (`chapter_overviews/chapter##_overview/`)
   - Study chapter content (`chapters/chapter##.md`)
   - Test knowledge with quiz bank (`quiz_banks/chapter##_quiz_bank/`)
   - Review missed questions and rationales
   - Use spaced repetition for retention

3. **Apply Learning Science:**
   - Active recall (test before reviewing)
   - Spaced repetition (review at intervals)
   - Elaborative interrogation (ask "why")
   - Interleaving (mix chapters)
   - Application (connect to real duties)

### For Instructors:

- Use master overview to plan curriculum
- Assign chapter overviews as pre-reading
- Use quiz banks for formative assessment
- Track student progress across chapters
- Identify common misconceptions from quiz results

### For Promotion Preparation:

- Focus on high-priority chapters (1, 3, 7-12, 20-24)
- Use quiz banks extensively for practice
- Review rationales to understand "why"
- Track performance to identify weak areas
- Use spaced repetition for long-term retention

## 🎓 Learning Science Integration

The system incorporates evidence-based learning principles:

1. **Spaced Repetition** - Review intervals recommended
2. **Active Recall** - Quiz banks emphasize retrieval practice
3. **Elaborative Interrogation** - Overviews explain "why"
4. **Interleaving** - Study paths mix related topics
5. **Dual Coding** - Encourages visual and verbal strategies

## 🔄 Regeneration

To regenerate any component:

```bash
# Regenerate quiz banks
python3 tools/generate_quiz_banks.py

# Regenerate learning system (overviews)
