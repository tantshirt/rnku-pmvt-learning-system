# Design Thinking Workshop: RNKUP Platform
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Facilitator:** Maya (Design Thinking Maestro)  
**Project:** RNKUP - AI-First Voice-Native Learning for Air Force Promotions

---

## Executive Summary

This Design Thinking workshop validated the user-centered approach for RNKUP through a comprehensive 5-phase process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. The workshop confirmed that solo E-4 to E-6 Airmen face critical gaps in exam preparation that voice-first AI tutoring can uniquely address.

**Key Findings:**
- Users need hands-free study during "dead time" (gym, commute, PT)
- Passive learning (PDFs, videos) fails for retention and engagement
- Solo learners lack feedback on readiness and weak areas
- Test anxiety stems from uncertainty, not lack of effort
- Voice-first interaction unlocks 5-10 hours/week of unusable study time

**Recommended MVP:** Integrated platform with AI tutor, voice-first interaction, adaptive intelligence, micro-learning architecture, and solo gamification.

## 1. Design Challenge

### Challenge Statement
> Create an AI-first, voice-native learning platform that empowers solo E-4 to E-6 Airmen to study for Air Force Promotion Fitness Exams (AFH1 content) through conversational tutoring and adaptive quizzing, replacing passive video lectures with active, dialog-based learning accessible anywhere, anytime.

### Primary Users
- **E-4 (Senior Airmen)** preparing for E-5 (Staff Sergeant) promotion
- **E-5 (Staff Sergeants)** preparing for E-6 (Technical Sergeant) promotion  
- **E-6 (Technical Sergeants)** preparing for further advancement
- Solo learners juggling military duties, deployments, and personal life

### Constraints
- **Technical**: Serverless architecture, cost optimization (<$0.005/user/month infrastructure)
- **Budget**: Must scale to 10,000+ users affordably
- **Time**: No video production overhead (removed Mux component)
- **Content**: Must be grounded in official AFH1 (24 chapters, 1,631 quiz concepts)

### Success Criteria
- 10,000+ active users
- High engagement (streaks, completion rates)
- Measurable exam score improvement
- Low-friction, fast experience (<400ms STT, <2s TTS)
- Cost-effective AI usage with model mixing

---

## 2. EMPATHIZE - User Research

### User Profile: Solo Airmen (E-4 to E-6)

**Demographics:**
- Rank: E-4 (Senior Airman), E-5 (Staff Sergeant), E-6 (Technical Sergeant)
- Context: Active duty with full-time military responsibilities
- Study Challenge: Must master 24 AFH1 chapters (1,631 potential quiz questions)
- Time Constraints: Juggling duty shifts, deployments, PT requirements, family obligations

### Pain Points Analysis

#### Static PDF Guides
- **Say**: "I just stare at hundreds of pages and zone out"
- **Think**: "Am I even retaining this?"
- **Do**: Re-read the same sections without retention
- **Feel**: Overwhelmed, bored, uncertain about progress

#### Basic Quiz Apps
- **Say**: "These flashcards are just memorization, not understanding"
- **Think**: "Will this actually help on the real test?"
- **Do**: Tap through cards mindlessly
- **Feel**: Disconnected from real learning

#### Video Lectures (Old Approach)
- **Say**: "I can't pause and ask questions"
- **Think**: "This is too passive - I'm not engaged"
- **Do**: Play videos in background while multitasking (low retention)
- **Feel**: Like a spectator, not a participant

### User Insights

**Study Context (Critical Pattern):**
- **When**: During commutes, PT cardio, between duties, late nights
- **Where**: Gym, car, barracks, deployed locations with limited internet
- **How Long**: 15-30 minute micro-sessions (not 2-hour study blocks)
- **Need**: Hands-free, voice-enabled, interruptible learning

**Motivation Drivers:**
- Promotion = career advancement + pay increase ($3k-$5k annually)
- Competitive promotion rates (limited slots)
- Pride in Air Force knowledge mastery
- Desire to lead and serve at higher levels

**Demotivation Factors:**
- Feeling alone in the process (no study buddy/tutor available)
- Uncertainty about weak areas
- Passive learning that doesn't stick
- No feedback on progress
- Information overload from 24 chapters

**Surprising Discoveries:**
- They WANT to understand "why" (not just memorize facts)
- They're comfortable with technology and AI
- Voice interaction appeals because they're multitasking constantly
- They trust official AFH1 content but need it "unlocked" for them
- Gamification works WITHOUT competitive leaderboards (solo personal bests)

### Empathy Map

| Says | Thinks | Does | Feels |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| "I need help NOW, not later" | "Am I studying the right stuff?" | Studies in short bursts | Isolated |
| "I don't have 2 hours to sit" | "Is this even going to be on test?" | Multitasks while learning | Overwhelmed |
| "PDFs put me to sleep" | "I wish I had a tutor" | Re-reads without retention | Uncertain |
| "I need to know my weak spots" | "Running out of time before exam" | Gym/commute = wasted study time | Anxious |

### Key Patterns
1. **Micro-learning over marathon sessions** - Need 15-30 min interactions
2. **Active over passive** - Want conversation, not consumption
3. **Voice-first is a game-changer** - Enables study during previously "dead time"
4. **Trust but verify** - Want citations back to AFH1 to build confidence
5. **Personal progress tracking** - Need to see weak areas and improvement

---

## 3. DEFINE - Problem Framing

### Point of View (POV) Statements

**Primary POV:**
> E-4 to E-6 Airmen need a personal tutor available 24/7 that adapts to their chaotic schedules and learning style because traditional study materials are passive, time-consuming, and isolate them during one of the most important career milestones, leaving them uncertain whether they're actually prepared for high-stakes promotion exams.

**Secondary POV (Contextual):**
> Solo military learners need to reclaim "dead time" (commutes, workouts, downtime) as productive study time because they don't have the luxury of 2-hour uninterrupted study blocks, yet they're competing for limited promotion slots against peers.

### "How Might We" Questions

1. **HMW make studying feel like having a conversation with a knowledgeable mentor** rather than reading a textbook alone?

2. **HMW transform "dead time" (driving, gym, downtime) into high-value study sessions** without requiring eyes or hands?

3. **HMW give learners real-time confidence about their readiness** instead of hoping they studied the right things?

4. **HMW provide AFH1 mastery with citations and context** so learners trust they're getting accurate, exam-relevant information?

5. **HMW make adaptive learning feel personalized and motivating** without the pressure of competing against others?

6. **HMW ensure learners focus on weak areas** instead of wasting time reviewing what they already know?

7. **HMW make AI tutoring feel natural and accessible** for military learners who may be skeptical of technology replacing human guidance?

### Problem Insights

**Insight #1: Passive Learning Fails for Retention**
- Problem: Reading PDFs or watching videos = low engagement = poor retention
- Opportunity: Active conversation + Socratic questioning = deeper encoding
- Impact: Users remember MORE with LESS study time

**Insight #2: Time Fragmentation is Reality, Not Exception**
- Problem: Current tools assume long, focused study blocks
- Opportunity: Voice-first enables micro-learning during activities (gym, commute)
- Impact: 15-30 min daily sessions > sporadic 2-hour cram sessions

**Insight #3: Uncertainty Kills Motivation**
- Problem: Learners don't know if they're ready until test day (too late)
- Opportunity: Continuous adaptive assessment reveals weak areas in real-time
- Impact: Confidence from knowing exactly where they stand

**Insight #4: Trust Requires Grounding**
- Problem: Generic quiz apps lack credibility and context
- Opportunity: RAG with AFH1 + citations = trust + deeper understanding
- Impact: Not just "what" but "why" - exam-aligned learning

**Insight #5: Solo Doesn't Mean Unsupported**
- Problem: No study buddy â‰  alone without support
- Opportunity: AI tutor as always-available wingman
- Impact: Feels supported without scheduling coordination

**Insight #6: Gamification Works When Personal**
- Problem: Leaderboards create anxiety in high-stakes contexts
- Opportunity: Personal streaks, badges, progress tracking
- Impact: Motivation from self-improvement, not comparison
